		<div id="history">
			<h3>
				A Brief History of the MPC
			</h3>
			<blockquote>“Self-education, I firmly believe, is the only kind of education there is.” Isaac Asimov</blockquote>
			<p>
				In 2011, Giancarlo Ibárgüen, former president of UFM, gave a speech called Noncoercive Teaching.
				Here's a picture of Giancarlo, the visionary behind MPC:
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/giancarlo-ibarguen.jpg" alt="Giancarlo Ibárgüen">
				<figcaption>
					Giancarlo Ibárgüen
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In his speech, Giancarlo outlined the educational future of UFM.
				The university should lead not just in Guatemala, but beyond.
				And for education to change, UFM would need to develop new models from within.
			</p>
			<p>
				This new model of education would need to embody non-coercion, a founding principle of UFM.
				The program should give students significant autonomy, use technology well, and rely on dialogue and other
				forms of learning rather than passive lectures by professors.
			</p>
			<p>
				In late 2012, the MPC sprang to life with 18 enthusiastic students.
				The MPC was to bring to education a model that mirrored <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-hayek/">F.A. Hayek's description of the market as a 'spontaneous order'.</a>
				Hayek described the competitive forces of the market as “a process of discovery."
				The MPC sought to create a continuous "process of discovery" for students.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original eighteen students, dubbed the 'Pioneers',
				came from different backgrounds but all wanted a change in their education.
				Ever since, the MPC has grown and worked to improve its model.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two years after its founding, the MPC pushed the notion of noncoercive teaching even
				further and reorganized as a radically student-led learning community.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now with four generations of students, the MPC continues to grow and thrive as a
				truly unique project within UFM and beyond.
			</p>
			<div id="twograds">
				<h3>
					A Tale of Two Graduates
				</h3>
				<h4>
					You will struggle in the MPC
				</h4>
				<p>A traditional college grad leaves university:<p>
					<p class="">with a horizontal network (knowing people mostly their same age and with their same interests)
						with a pensum (transcript of courses)
						with lots of fake "work" for classes
						with the habits of a professional student and little to no work experience
						thinking inside the box
						with the habits of adapting life to school
				</p>
				<p>
					An MPC graduate leaves university with:
						with a mixed network (know people of many ages and stages of life with many different interests)
						with a portfolio of real work and pensum (transcript of courses)
						with actual, real work
						with professional experience including time-on-the-job
						having made the box
						with the habit of adapting school to life
			</p>
			<p>
				These different ways of graduating make a radical difference in the life and career prospects of a graduate.
			</p>
			<p>
				The challenge for students is to break and unlearn old habits and mindsets developed during earlier stages of education.
				For example:
				We're used to having our hands held
				We're used to taking orders
				We're used to only doing fake work like traditional tests or essays
			</p>
			<p>
				A creative professional can't afford to do this.
				As MPCers grow into creative professionals, they pass through a
				difficult period of adjustment where they learn to direct themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Struggle during this period is perfectly normal.
				We call it "working out the bullsh**t". A more polite way might be to call it "unlearning."
				Everybody inherits bad mindsets and habits from their past education.
				We're all on a road to get better.
				The reward for becoming an unconventional graduate is worth the struggle.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="mindset">
			<h3>Mindset</h3>
			<p>
				The MPC is built on the growth mindset.
				We focus on habits of learning rather than a specific curriculum built on textbooks or lectures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Important habits include:
					risk-taking
					a willingness to fail
					perseverance
					lifelong learning
					self-discipline
					self-direction
			</p>
			<p>
				Someone with a 'growth mindset' believes that talents and skills can be cultivated and learned.
				Indeed, they must be – if the learner wants to become great.
				So the person with a growth mindset focuses on hard work, good habits, and rising to meet new challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
				The opposite of a growth mindset is a 'fixed mindset'.
				People with this mindset believe that their intelligence, skills, or personality traits are set for life.
				People with fixed mindsets avoid challenge and risk, because it threatens their ego and identity as a "smart" or "skilled" person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those with a growth mindset treat life as a constant adventure and every new challenge as a chance to learn and grow.
				The MPC gives students a chance to change their mindset and become lifelong learners.
			</p>

					Here's a summary.
				</a>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<div id="needs">
			<h3>What do I need for the MPC?</h3>
			<p>
				A well-functioning modern laptop.
				Your laptop is an indispensable part of your education.
				Consider it an investment in your future.
				Most people use Macs in the MPC, but PCs are fine too.
				However, if you use a PC, it's your responsibility to deal with problems like computer viruses.
				We don't recommend 'netbooks' or Macbook Airs.
				They are not powerful enough for many projects, don't include CD/DVD drive, and have occasional hardware problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				What about books? Most readings can be found digitally.
				We'll rarely ask for you to buy physical copies of books, although you are free to do so if you prefer to read that way.
				A lot of MPCers are bibliophiles and know tons of books.
				Ask them if you need something to read, or check out our lending library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why do we have so many books?
				We are a reading culture in the MPC. Reading is a habit and you get better at it through practice.
				Obviously scientists or professors read a lot.
				But you would be amazed to know that business leaders, artists, programmers, designers, whoever also devote a lot of time to reading.
				Reading feeds your brain.
				Creativity is often about making connections between things that others haven't seen.
				A great way to do that is to keep feeding your brain. The more you read the
				more you CAN read and the more fun it is TO read.
				The more broadly you read, the more possible connections you have.
				Nearly all smart and successful people are readers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Software?
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend Microsoft Office and design programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.
				These are not absolutely necessary since Google Docs exists, but they come in handy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Creative materials?
				If you want to spend your time working on a craft that requires lots of materials such as painting,
				you are responsible for those materials. The MPC does have some materials available.
				These are shared and you can't always count on their availability.
				Bring what you need. If you don't want people to use your stuff, make sure you CLEARLY label what's yours.
				Put it in a locked container. We're a trustworthy bunch, but it's better to avoid any problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				UFM also has many great materials as a university.
				The <a href="http://www.biblioteca.ufm.edu/index.php/P%C3%A1gina_principal">library Ludwig von Mises</a>
				is very, very good.
				Use your student carnet to check out books.
				Careful though, they charge high fines if you return stuff late.
			</p>
			<p>
				UFM also offers access to databases like an <a href="http://www.biblioteca.ufm.edu/index.php/Recursos_digitales">Electronic Book Library</a> and
				scholarly journal databases like <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conferences, events, and other opportunities are regularly shared on Slack, posted on our bulletin board,
				and distributed via UFM's mailing list called <a href="http://asomate.ufm.edu/">ASOMATE</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="slack">
				<h3>
					MPChat with Slack
				</h3>
				<p>
					When you enroll in the MPC, we'll invite you to our private online chatroom. We use a platform called Slack.
					Slack is divided into independent chat rooms called channels.
					Most of the channels should be pretty obvious.
					Put cool stuff for others in "#share", put experiences in "#experiences", and put lolcats and other stupid/cool stuff in "#random".
				</p>
				<figure id="content-image">
					<img src="images/tacocat.jpg" alt="tacocat">
					<figcaption>
						This goes in #Random.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					#Announcements and #Admin-Announcements are the most important channel to follow
					since we use it for official MPC events, visitors, and info.
					Please be respectful of others on Slack.
				</p>
				<h4 class="warning">WARNING:</h4>
				<p>
					We almost never use email. It is your responsibility to check Slack so that you don't miss important stuff.
				</p>
				<figure class="group">

			</div>
			<div id="hours">
				<h3>
					Hours and the MPC Space
				</h3>
				<p>The MPC space at UFM is open from 7:00 to 9:00pm, Monday through Friday. Often we're open even later but, officially, we close at 9.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a student of the MPC, you have exclusive access to this space. You are always welcome. Please be respectful of others and the resources of the MPC.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="visitors">
				<h3> Visitors Policy</h3>
				<p>
					Visitors are welcome in the MPC if they are part of your work. Bring your co-founder, your mentor, your bandmate. Every visitor must be sponsored by a student.
				</p>
				<p>
					The student will be held responsible for the visitor's behavior. Visitors must be respectful of MPCers who are doing work. We want to avoid random visitors abusing MPC materials or filling the MPC space and ruining the experience for students.	Visitors can be asked to leave at any time by students or MPC staff if they are disruptive.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="schedule">
				<h3>MPC Schedule</h3>
				<p>
					Bootcamp courses are scheduled by students and their tutor during the course design workshop. We don't usually schedule things into the evening because we believe you need time with friends, family, loved ones, and to do other activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MPC does not have an official daily schedule. The schedule emerges from the courses and experiences designed by MPCers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's important to check Slack, your email, and your calendar regularly if you want to know what’s going on.
				</p>

			<h4>The Long Game – Understanding Creative Development</h4>
			<p>
				We've designed the MPC to emulate the time-tested process of creative development. First, you connect with a creative calling through exploration and practice. Then you put yourself through a rigorous self-apprenticeship. And finally you break out on your own as you start to work professionally and prepare your first Great Work.
			</p>
			<p>
				These two videos stress the important of your own responsibility to yourself and your education. There's no one to hold your hand in the long run.

			<h3>Writing in MPC</h3>
			<p>
				Good writing is clear thinking made visible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever path you take, you need to write well. We recommend that if you are uncomfortable making strong arguments through writing that you begin with a book review. Book reviews are less critical and more structured. Essays are freer and include more of your voice. You graduate to the freedom of the essay through rigorous practice of the review.
			</p>
			<p>
				Students start to learn writing through their work in Bootcamp. By the second half of the year, students are expected to become more critical and write lengthier, more personal essay on their reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				We often publish together on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/@zachcaceres/the-mpc-guide-to-stress-free-publishing-on-medium-7acd451fcd29">click here for a how-to guide!</a>).
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Help! I need structure to write!
			</p>
			<p>
				For students who want a structured approach to writing, you can follow this process.
				It’s meant to map to the four weeks of a Bootcamp course and ends up with a structured book review.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><strong>Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction</strong>
					<li>Read preface, introduction, and at least the first chapter of the book.</li>
					<li>Read liner notes and any commentary on the back cover.Quickly look at the final chapter or conclusion.</li>
					<li>Write your introduction. Now get reading! You probably should schedule clear reading goals so you finish on-time. Talk to staff/resident or MPCer if you need help with this.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><strong>Week 2: Outline and Chapters</strong>
					<li>Finish your reading this week.</li>
					<li>Coordinate your notes and start to synthesize them into paragraph-length summaries of each chapter.</li>
					<li>Don't just regurgitate. Have some style. Remember that one short, powerful quote is worth more than ten huge block quotes.</li>
					<li>Write an outline of your review.</li>
					<li>Write drafts of the paragraphs devoted to summarizing main ideas.</li>
					<li>Write a first draft of the final paragraph where you offer your own opinion of the book.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><strong>Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review Time for some serious editing</strong>
					<li>Find a friend for peer review.</li>
					<li>Read your work out loud and have them take notes and give feedback.</li>
					<li>Listen to how your writing sounds as you speak it</li>
					<li>If it sounds confusing or dumb when it's said – it's bad writing</li>
					<li>Finish your first draft</li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InB9QeJ0qQxazB9ND8TT6mXFqtKxAoMmcnUwBKAMCRo/edit">Here's a checklist for peer review</a>, if you need it.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><strong>Week 4: Final Draft</strong>
					<li>Polish your draft and add any additional citations.</li>
					<li>Write your bibliography.</li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1do1op-_3iTYL1FXMEXacLEHzs77webrJmNp7RRZn5Tw/edit?usp=sharing">Here's a checklist for final draft review </a></li>

			<div id="trips">
				<h3>MPC Group Excursions</h3>
				<p>
					Each semester we organize one trip for the whole program. These are opportunities to adventure, learn, and see new places. Trips typically have themes and we assign readings and talk together when we reach our destination. We make some time unstructured during the trips for spontaneous discovery. You are free to go your own way to experience the destination.
				</p>
				<p>
					We plan these trips in advance. If you confirm your attendance and then cancel at the last minute we will bill you the cost of your trip. This is just like an airline reservation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not all trips can accommodate the entire MPC. Some may have limited seats. We give seats based on the first people who have signed up, paid, and brought in any paperwork that we need. Register early!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="residents">
				<h3>Residency Program</h3>
				<p>
					The MPC Residency Program is an opportunity for alumni and others to stay connected to the MPC.

				<p class="faq">
					How does it work?
				</p>
				<p>
					The MPC offers a few slots each semester like “Entrepreneur in Residence”, “Filmmaker in Residence”, “Writer in Residence”, or “Artist in Residence”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Residents apply through a competitive process to the residency. The MPC accepts the best applicant. Residents will be given free access to the MPC and to MPC events/visitors/facilities. They are able to use the MPC space as a co-working environment, including for co-founder or other colleagues. Residents will also be able to use MPC tools like recording or film equipment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Residencies last for a semester. Some residencies will include a modest stipend for the resident’s work in the MPC and funds to cover parking at UFM.
				</p>
				<p>
					Residents may also be eligible for free or special group rates on trips or other MPC experiences.
				</p>

				<h3>The People You'll Meet</h3>
				<p>
					Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty like a normal academic department. Here are some people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.
				</p>
				<h4>Residents</h4>
				<p>
					We keep residents on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Residents give seminars about areas that they're interested in. They hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses, studies, or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately.
				</p>
				<p>
					Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others. Residents are also there if you need to talk about something. They'll check in occasionally to see how you're doing toward your goals.
				</p>
				<h4>Tutors</h4>
				<p>
					During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professionals from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 12-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					We bring in a tutor for each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. These experts take you through the main ideas and are available to answer questions during unstructured time at the MPC. It's your responsibility to talk to them if you're confused.
					Tutors also provide grades for each Bootcamp subject.
				</p>
				<h4>Mentors</h4>
				<p>
					The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorships.For example, a student may study programming and have a professional programmer evaluate their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them. Mentors give you grades for your final work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember, mentors are often busy people. You don't want to bother them too often. You should view the mentor as a professional contact, not a 'teacher'. You don't ask your mentor, "What is the answer to question 3?" Go find the information. Go practice. Go do the work. The mentor is there for you bring your work for feedback. "How am I doing?" "I'm really stuck on this part."
				</p>
				<p>
					Mentors also can provide the practical, hands-on experience that books and professors cannot. "How do I make a rigorous practice regimen for the guitar?" "What's the best way to approach a client?" But you shouldn't view mentors only as people who give feedback and grades. A good mentorship is often the first step to a job or other professional and life opportunities. Treat your mentors well because they can become lifelong friends and contacts.
				</p>
				<h4>Visiting Professors</h4>
				<p>
					We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities. Visitors dialogue and spend time with students. Take advantage of the short time these visitors are here!

			<h3>Internships</h3>
			<p>
				<blockquote class="decor">Not I, but the city teaches. – Socrates</blockquote>
				The MPC requires all students to pursue an internship in their second year. You can do it either semester. You can do as many internships as you want. But you must do at least one in your second year. Internships are typically part of one of the 5-UMA courses that you design as part of your Learning Contract.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Why Internships?
			</p>
			<p>
				Internships are the best way for you to get professional experience in an area that interests you. The modern internship evolved from the apprenticeships of the past. Apprentices were junior members of a craft. They learned by working closely with a master. Their work was often unglamorous, as internships sometimes are today, but the proximity to the master craftsman more than paid for the work.
			</p>
			<p>
				An internship is a great way to learn whether you actually like a field or industry. You can see how a real professional works. Internships also are ways to build your network. Working first as an intern often lead to jobs or other professional opportunities. You should treat your internship as a serious job and part of your education.
			</p>
			<h3>Finding an Awesome Internship</h3>
			<p>As you work with mentors during Bootcamp and in your Learning Contracts, watch for opportunities to intern. Many people want an intern. It's nice to have someone who wants to help you (usually for free), and who is interested in your work. Many people don't know they want an intern until you suggest it... so ask!
			</p>
			<p>
				The MPC has a rich network of possible internships. Talk to residents, classmates, mentors, and anyone else around the MPC. Someone will know somebody who can help. On-site internships are preferred but, if necessary, an internship could even be conducted digitally, with tools like Skype and Googledocs.
			</p>
			<p>
				If existing internships look boring, pitch your own. Many times a business or other organization can be convinced to offer a new internship based around what you want to learn, as long as it makes value for their organization. If you need help with how to approach an internship opportunity, talk to someone with more experience.
			</p>
			<h4 class="warning">WARNING!</h4>
			<p>
				The MPC can help you make a connection, but you are responsible for approaching the mentor and convincing them to employ you as an intern.
			</p>
			<p>
				Convincing people to employ you is a valuable and important life skill and it's part of your education. Make sure you check out visa requirements if you're traveling abroad!
			</p>
			<h3>Confirming your Internship with the MPC</h3>
			<p>
				Your internship must be confirmed via the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BzxEk7u4UzLBZnN3anN2bDhaSFU/view?usp=sharing">Mentor Agreement Form.</a> This is so we know you have secured your internship. Usually your boss signs the Mentor Agreement form because they’re the ones who evaluate you.

			<h3>Centro Henry Hazlitt Requirements for MPC></h3>
			<p>
				UFM requires all students to pass basic economic proficiency exams to graduate. This is taught and tested through <a href="http://chh.ufm.edu">Centro Henry Hazlitt (CHH).</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				MPC students must pass an exam that tests:
				<ul>
					<li>Basic Economics (called Proceso 1 and 2 at UFM)</li>
					<li>Filisofía de Hayek</li>
					<li>Ética (a philosophy class)</li>
					<li>Four exams in all.</li>
					<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ufm.edu/document/d/1V3X8qtIW-WG_W-2q58YmcgR3ilVAOedSXVW5PUdG3YU/edit?usp=sharing">Read all about the logistics of these exams here.</a></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The MPC has <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ufm.edu/document/d/1V3X8qtIW-WG_W-2q58YmcgR3ilVAOedSXVW5PUdG3YU/edit?usp=sharing">a list of all the concepts and ideas from these courses.</a> If you don't understand some of these concepts, use these resources to help you.
			</p>
			<p>You can learn these ideas in any way you want. You can find a tutor, you can work together, you can ask us to help, you can go online etc. When you're ready, you take the test. If you pass, you'll have fulfilled the graduation requirement.
			</p>
			<h4 class="warning">WARNING!</h4>
			<p>
				If you fail this test three times, you are expelled from UFM per the rules of the university!
			</p>
			<p>
				But don't be worried about this requirement. The ideas are not difficult and everyone who has graduated from UFM has passed these tests. Though the ideas aren't difficult, they are tremendously valuable for helping you understand the world. You can get this requirement out of the way as soon as you wish.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="degree">
			<h3>Degree and Concentraton</h3>
			<p>
				The MPC awards B.A. degrees in Liberal Studies with a concentration that you define. A sample degree would read, "Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="inventory">
			<h3>MPC Inventory</h3>
			<p>
				The MPC has a range of supplies available for students. Some of it will be in display for easy access (things like post-its, markers, staples, and tape), while other more delicate equipment requires a different procedure (things like cameras, tripods, and audio recorders). Ask in the office for supplies. Please take care of the things we have so they're available to everyone!

		<div id="mpcer">
			<h3>The MPCer</h3>
			<p>
				As an MPCer, you were chosen as members of a rare breed. MPCers show a rare combination of unconventional attitudes and creative potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a world where many people accept mediocrity in their lives, MPC-ers truly care about their futures and the learning they'll need to create it. MPCers aren't afraid to question and they always think for themselves. MPCers rely on themselves and try to be logically consistent. MPCer´s are thinkers and doers, dreamers and creators, artists and entrepreneurs. They are passionate human beings that love what they do and are always improving.
			</p>
			<h4>No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a></h4> <!--link here-->
			<p>
				MPCers don't feel threatened by the success of others. Instead of cutting down people who are achieving, an MPCer sees another person's success as an opportunity to learn and collaborate with that person.
			</p>
			<p> <!--special format here-->
				It's all about Creative Professionalism. MPCers train to be pros.

		<div id="changes">
			<h3>How to Propose Changes to the MPC</h3>
			<h4>When something isn't working well</h4>
			<p>
				Occasionally, the MPC program changes. New opportunities emerge, or we discover that something doesn't work well. We are always interested in improving the program, so bring us your ideas!
			</p>
			<p>
				Seriously. We will listen to you. Bring us ideas to improve the MPC.
			</p>
			<p>
				However if we change the program based on the demands of small groups or single students, we create unhealthy power dynamics. Students then form coalitions and try to lobby the administration to change policies. This is a bad way to create a healthy community.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the rule is simple: If you think something needs to be changed, first talk with your fellow MPCers. Convince a large group of them why things would be better with a change. Propose your change publicly. No backroom politics! Once you have consensus, bring the idea to the MPC administration.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Why do we do this?
			</p>
			<p>
				To avoid the unhealthy power dynamics To make sure no one has major changes randomly imposed on them, without any idea of what's coming To encourage group coherence and cooperation Because if everybody agrees with a change, it's probably an important one to make.

				<h3> MPC: Pre-Semester Program </h3>
				<h4> Get a Head Start </h4>
				<p>
					The Pre-MPC Term is a chance to practice the self-directed study format of Year 2 and 3 through a funded MPC Learning Contract. You'll become familiar with the MPC methodology, explore your interests and build skills of self-discipline which will put you at an advantage before entering the MPC three-year program. The pre-semester also provides you the opportunity to enhance your MPC curriculum with an extra semester of courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pre-MPC Costs are the same as any other term in the MPC.
					<h4>Cost Per Semester</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Tuition per Semester: $4,000</li>
						<li>UFM Service Monthly Fee: $41</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Full payment information is available in

	this document</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Credits</h4>
					UMAs will be awarded and will appear on your transcripts along with each course. These UMAs are extra credits to enhance your degree, they are not considered substitute credits for the official program. You are still required to follow up with the complete three year Program and accomplish the full 150 UMAs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Pre-Semester Courses</h4>
					The Pre-Semester comes with a standard set of courses. Some are fixed and others can be designed by you. Each is worth 5 UMAs and is evaluated by letter-grade (‘nota literal’).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Learning How to Learn (Aprendiendo a Aprender)</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this course, students are challenged to reexamine the ways in which they learn. Students will practice the skills of a self-directed learner, learn to become conscious of their own habits and learning process, and experiment with different learning techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Self-Directed Study (Estudio Autodirigido)</strong>
					In this course, the student has the chance to design a course of study using the MPC methodology and tools. Courses may be on any subject of the student’s interest and can employ online, experiential, and collaborative learning or other tools.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Independent Project (Proyecto Independiente)</strong>
					Students design and execute an independent project of their own.
					Projects are expected to be concrete and take forms like a prototype, a product, or a published work.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Professional Development (Desarrollo Profesional)</strong>
					In this course, students have the opportunity to begin to bridge their professional and academic lives through an internship or work-study opportunity. Internships are led by the student and they are expected to receive a successful letter of recommendation at the end of the experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Experiential Learning (Aprendizaje Experiencial)</strong>
					Students demonstrate leadership and explore their subject of interest by designing, planning, and executing experiences for co-learners
					Students also design, plan, and complete a Milestone Challenge: an endeavor that forces them to reach outside their comfort zone like presenting a lecture, traveling by themselves, or overcoming a major fear.
				</p>
				<p>
					You receive a Fellow's Fund of Q5000 for their pre-semester contract. The MPC is happy to help with tutors, orienting a new student to the contract process, and with other needs.

					<h3>Equivalencies for UFM Students not in the MPC</h3>
					<h4>Design-Your-Own-Course for Other Faculties at UFM</h4>
					<p>
						MPC offers students of other faculties the opportunity to design their own course for UMA credits in the MPC ('equivalencias' in Spanish). To participate in this program, you must get permission from your home faculty to have UMAs awarded for work in the MPC. Typically they allow only one or two courses designed in the MPC.
					</p>
					<p>
						You must also pass MPC admissions with a portfolio, short essay, and interview. If you pass this process, you will be enrolled for the equivalencies and also have unrestricted access to the MPC space and most activites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Students participating in MPC equivalencies submit a learning contract just like MPC Fellows. They must also <a href="#Milestone">complete a Milestone</a> and <a href="#Experience">one experience</a> during their semester.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="crits">
					<h3>Crits Day</h3>
					<h4>Let's eat sushi and celebrate</h4>
					<p>
						At the end of each semester, we hold an event called Crits Day. "Crits" refers to 'criticism', a common process in design schools. On Crits Day, everyone brings their portfolio to share and to receive feedback from others. If you're traveling, you'll need to Skype in to share your portfolio.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have Crits Day to encourage people to document their work and to add to their portfolio each semester. A great portfolio is the mark of a creative professional. It's also a time to celebrate everyone's hard work and accomplishments from the past semester. We'll order food, break into groups, and get sharing!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="crisis">
					<h3>Mid-Semester Crisis Day</h3>
					<h4>HELP I've lost my way!</h4>
					<p>
						As the semester goes along, lots of MPCers begin to face some struggles. Towards the middle of each semester, we hold a day for people to bring any MPC-related issues that you have. Let's talk about your Great Work, a course you're failing, and your latest existential crisis. Check the MPC calendar for the date and time. See you there.

	<h2>Part 3: Learning Contracts and your Fellowship Years</h2>
	<div id="manifesto">
		<h3>Why We Learning Contract</h3>
		<h4>A Manifesto</h4>
		<blockquote class="decor">
		“All the world is my classroom, all humanity is my teacher” George Whitman
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Philosophy of the Learning Contract</h4>
		<p>
			Most schools ask you to make a choice: are you learning academics (‘education’), or are you pursuing professional work (‘job’)? This is a false choice. Creative leaders make no difference between their professional and academic life. Constant learning is how you become a better professional. Period.
		<figure>
			<img src="images/image23.gif" alt="rockos modern life'">
		</figure>
		</p>
		<p>
			And the best way to learn is to work in real-life. Lectures, books, and classes are great, but hard work and the pursuit of real-world projects gives your education substance.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Learning Contract allows nearly anything to become part of your education. Use the contract to design courses to support your work, or to put your studies into action through a creative project of your own.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ultimately, creative development is about positive habits. In the MPC, education is about cultivating these habits. <a href="http://medium.com/mpc-reads/education-is-about-habits-a27c22bc2c56#.f1h9hy7sf"> Read more about why we use Learning Contracts here.</a>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="tshaped">
		<h3>T-Shaped Graduates</h3>
		<p>
			The MPC wants you to graduate as a T-Shaped Person. What’s that, you say?
		</p>
		<p>
			Here’s how Tim Brown, CEO of world-famous design firm IDEO, describes them:
			<figure id="content-image">
				<img src="images/Tim_brown_ted.jpg" alt="Tim Brown">
				<figcaption>
					Tim Brown, Famous Designer CEO guy
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>
		<blockquote class="content-quote"> T­-shaped people have two kinds of characteristics, hence the use of the letter “T” to describe them. The vertical stroke of the “T” is a depth of skill that allows them to contribute to the creative process. That can be from any number of different fields: an industrial designer, an architect, a social scientist, a business specialist or a mechanical engineer.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote class="content-quote">
			The horizontal stroke of the “T” is the disposition for collaboration across disciplines. It is composed of two things. First, empathy. It’s important because it allows people to imagine the problem from another perspective [and]­ to stand in somebody else’s shoes. Second, [T-shaped people] tend to get very enthusiastic about other people’s disciplines, to the point that they may actually start to practice them. T-shaped people have both depth and breadth in their skills.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			In short, a T-shaped person has the ability to converse and collaborate comfortably with people different from themselves. But the T-shaped person also knows enough about their own field that they bring distinct value to the process.
		</p>

			<h3>You Are Now a Fellow</h3>
			<h4>It’s sort of like Lord of the Rings</h4>
			<p>
			You are now a fellow in your Fellowship years. This is a weird English thing, so in case you’re wondering:
			<blockquote class="content-quote">
				[fel-oh-ship]
				noun
				friendly relationship; companionship
				community of interest, feeling, etc.
				an association of persons having similar tastes, interests, etc.
				a company, guild, or corporation.

			</p>
			<p>
				The MPC does not set your schedule. There is no such thing as an attendance policy. You get a check each month from the MPC. Sweet deal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fellows design their entire semester through Learning Contracts (that’s why you’re reading this, right?). Fellows also receive Fellows Funding (see Ca$hMoney below). Fellows are autonomous, self-directed learners in the MPC. They may travel, work, research, and do any other activities that contribute to their education.
			</p>
			<p>
				To do well during your Fellowship, you really only need to do three things:
				<ul>
					<li>Practice your craft (often)</li>
					<li>Make real things</li>
					<li>Hustle opportunities</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you keep these three principles in mind and practice them consistently, your life will radically change. It sounds simple, but it’s actually quite hard. The Learning Contract system formalizes these steps and holds you accountable for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here’s how it works.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="process">
			<h3>Learning Contracts</h3>
			<h4>Commit. Practice. Deliver. Grow.</h4>

				<strong>The Steps</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Reflect on your learning goals</li>
					<li>Think of processes and opportunities that will bring you closer to them</li>
					<li>Plan your courses (see “Courses are Buckets” below)</li>
					<li>Fill out the Learning Contract Submission Form, which is posted in Slack</li>
					<li>You’ll get an email from Google with a link to your contract. It lets you edit your contract in the future.</li>
					<li>Save this link. For real, don’t forget this step!</li>
					<li>Get your Mentor Agreement signed (for all four courses)</li>
					<li>Get your Grading Rubric signed (for all four courses)</li>
					<li>Upload the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BzxEk7u4UzLBZnN3anN2bDhaSFU/view?usp=sharing">Mentor Agreement</a> and

			<h4>(a.k.a Ca$h Money, feat. UrBankAccount)</h4>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image10.gif" alt="making it rain">
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Fellows Fund is a personal fund that students use to secure mentors, manage their courses, and invest in their future as the creator of their own education. The Fellows Fund is entirely yours to manage. We won’t tell you how to spend it.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Why do we give you money?
			</p>
			<p>
				As any true gangster knows: money + brain + hustle = FREEDOM!
				<figure class="group">
					<img src="images/image08.gif" alt="Braveheart meme">
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
			Having your own funds gives you greater flexibility when designing a course. You decide how to invest in your education. You get to bargain for free mentorships, or pay for expensive mentors, trips, gear, whatever.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most importantly, it puts you in the driver’s seat of your own education. You have to decide how best to spend your funds. The best way to learn how to manage money is to manage your own. That takes care of the money + hustle part of the equation.
			</p>
			<p class="warning">
				But remember it’s money + BRAIN + hustle = freedom.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you blow all your cash on stupid stuff, the MPC will not pay your mentors apart from the money allotted for your Fellows Fund. Keep a good account of your money.
			</p>
			<p class="warning">
				Warning!
			</p>
			<p>
				Once again:You are responsible for paying your mentors what you owe them if you blow all your money!
			</p>

			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Ok I get it. How do I get my money?
			</p>
			<p>
				As you plan your learning contract, consider costs for each course. Remember, mentors that are giving you their time probably want some payment!
			</p>
			<p>
				After you turn in your final contract and all mentor agreement forms, the MPC begins to fill your Fellows Fund (Q7200 per term, dispersed in monthly chunks). This happens every semester in the second and third year. The transfer will go directly to your bank account. Fellows Fund should cover stuff like books, lab materials, subscriptions to online courses, mentors and anything else you need to have an awesome semester.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each course, you need to negotiate a payment for your mentor. Remember that UFM mentors can often help for free. Set your fees using the Mentor Agreement form.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use your Fellows Fund for any other expenses that you have while you do your contract. For shared courses, students should agree beforehand who will pay for what
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				“But,” you say, “I want to save my money so I can do this!”
				<figure class="group">
					<img src="images/image25.gif" alt="sleeping on pile of money">
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				You’re in luck. Your funds do not expire at the end of each semester. So you can save up money to invest in something bigger at a later date.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="lose">
			<h3>How to Lose Your Money</h3>
			<h4>By being irresponsible and short-sighted and we have to fine you, which we seriously don’t want to do</h4>
			<p>
				If you’re late turning in stuff or for other important deadlines, the MPC deducts fines from your Fellow's Fund each day something is late.
				Q75 the first day
				Q25 each additional day
			</p>
			<p>
				You will not receive your Fellows Fund until:
				You submit an approved Learning Contract
				You submit all your confirmed mentor agreements and grading rubrics
				You are solvent with the MPC + UFM
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Help! I don’t have a bank account.
			</p>
			<p>
				For real? How do you intend to take over the world without a bank account?
				<figure class="group">
					<img src="images/image13.gif" alt="pinky and the brain">
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Managing your own finances is an important part of your independence! So go get a bank account. You can open one right here at UFM through the Banco Industrial branch below the MPC. You’ll need to share your bank account data with the MPC so we can make the transfer.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Help! I suck at sticking to my commitments.
			</p>
			<p>
				You're in luck! Have trouble forming a habit or worried that you’ll flake on a commitment? Write a commitment contract with the MPC.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are small agreements where you pledge money to do a task (lose ten pounds by March, read five books by June). Bring your contract that specifies how much money you want to pledge. We will hold the money. If you satisfy the commitment, you get the money back. If you don’t, you forfeit the money to the MPC which will use it to improve the space.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="bucket">
			<h3>Courses are Buckets</h3>
			<h4>Fill Them with Creative Life Things</h4>
			<p>
				You must design four courses each semester. Each course is a ‘bucket’ that you can fill with nearly anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now is your chance to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_I4wtNPv5w">make your dreams come true</a>, be a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qHX493bB3U">wild thing</a>, and do <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlV2dzXWCw">hot stuff</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your standard issue semester looks like this:
				<table class="courses">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Course Designed By You</td>
							<td>5 UMAs</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Course Designed By You</td>
							<td>5 UMAs</td>

							<td>Experiential Learning</td>
							<td>5 UMAs</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Total</td>
							<td>25 UMAs</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			<p>
				Four slots are for the courses your design. The last slot, “Experiential Learning”, is for your experiences and Milestone (more on that later).

			<h3>Learning Contract Canvas</h3>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image01.gif" alt="bob ross painting">
			</figure>
			<p>
				Here’s some canvases you can use to organize your thoughts. This is just a tool to organize yourself. You don’t have to send it to us (and we don’t want you to because our email is too full already).
			</p>
			<p>
				This canvas helps you visualize your entire contract <a href="http://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BzxEk7u4UzLBS1hJQ1NveXdZaDA/view?usp=sharing">This one is for each course you design</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are the sections to think about as you’re planning courses:
			</p>
			<h4>Course Description (in English y Español)</h4>
			<p>
				Describe the course in a formal and academic way. (See some tips below!)
			</p>
			<h4>Objective</h4>
			<p>
				What am I trying to do here? See “... have concrete objectives” below.
			</p>
			<h4>Mentor</h4>
			<p>
				Must be an expert.
				Must sign the mentor agreement and agree to the grading rubric.
				Cannot be a family member or other close relation (this includes your 27 cousins).
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/latin_cousins.gif" alt="latin cousins meme">
			</figure>
			<h4>Grade Type</h4>
			<p>
				Starting 2016, the only option is Letter Grade. Letter grade means A, B, C, D, F.
				Anything under a C is a ‘fail’ for MPC. You should almost always choose letter grade.
			</p>
			<h4>Open Course</h4>
			<p>
				Use this to list the names of your fellow MPCers if you’re designing a course together. Everyone must submit the same information if you’re sharing a course.
			</p>
			<h4>Practice</h4>
			<p>
				What strategies, projects, jobs, commitments, courses, etc. will you undertake to improve yourself during this course? See below for why practice is everything!
			</p>
			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<p>
				List specific materials (MOOCs, books, movies, experiences etc.) that you’ll use to learn and practice. MPC has tons of suggestions if you’re lost.
			</p>
			<h4>Final Evaluation</h4>
			<p>
				The project you’ll do to prove that you learned. DO REAL WORK. See below for how to DO REAL WORK.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="uma">
			<h3>What the **** is an UMA?</h3>
			<h4>TIME: it’s scary and really powerful</h4>
			<p>
				UFM organizes courses through credits called "UMAs". UMAs keep track of your progress toward graduation. If you were taking a traditional course, this would sum the hours you sit in lectures.
			</p>
			<p>
				An UMA is equivalent to 15 hours of work. Every course in MPC is worth 5 UMAs. Keep this in mind as you plan your semester. You need to justify why each course is worth 5-UMAs by designing a thorough and rigorous course.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each semester at the MPC is worth 25 UMAs. That's 375 hours of work.
			</p>
			<p>
				That might sound like a lot, but it’s only about 9 1/2 weeks of work at a full-time job (40 hours a week). You have eighteen weeks to accomplish your goals for the semester. That leaves extra time to do cool things and to take advantage of sudden opportunities.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="rant">
			<h3>It’s Rant Time! (About Time)</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>You are going to die one day.</h4>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image22.gif" alt="jimmy kimmel">
				<figcaption>
					(Weren’t expecting that, were you?)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The time you have to spare each semester means you should almost always be busy working on your craft and taking advantage of new opportunities that arise. Probably, you shouldn’t spend it on another playthrough of Call of Duty.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you spend lots of hours each week (or each day!) on Facebook/video games/gossip/parties, you should seriously consider your priorities. You can’t have it all. So decide today just what is important to you and commit to spending your time that way.
			</p>
			<figure id="content-image">
				<img src="images/image27.gif" alt="kanye annoyed">

			<p>
				The greatest asset you have is how you spend your time. Time is the great equalizer. It creates and destroys all things, all people.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can’t control our heights, our skin colors, how much money we were born into. But, especially while young and mostly free of responsibilities, you can control your time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Time is also the best way to see a person’s true character. If you’re trying to see what someone’s made of, don’t look at what they say — just watch what they do. A person who is always wasting their time says many things about themselves (and almost none of those things are good...)
			</p>
			<p>
				Since your mortal clock is ticking, use your time wisely. The heights of your creative achievement depend on your ability to improve yourself over time.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofa7ZtwwW00PdBLjm-amK20WyqC6yYbarIT4bOeRCdU/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet like this</a> to quantify your time working. This keeps you focused and tracks your progress. Humans also love to fool themselves about how hard they’re working. A spreadsheet makes sure you aren’t lying to yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				What does your time say about you?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="experience">
			<h3>Experiences</h3>
			<h4>Get Credit for Hanging Out Together</h4>
			<p>
				Experiences bring strong community in the MPC. Every semester, Fellows (that means you) are required to provide two experiences to the MPC community. You must provide two experiences, even if you're traveling. Get creative.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can organize a dance class or a workshop on debate. You could lead a field trip or other excursion. You can bring in a visiting speaker. If you're traveling, you can Skype in for your experience. You could also produce a video and organize a screening to share it with the MPC instead.
			</p>
			<p class="warning">
				Procrastination Warning!

			<figure id="content-image">
				<img src="images/image20.gif" alt="daria procrastinating">

					Don't put all your experiences at the end of the term. First, you'll be busy with your final evaluations. Second, space and time fill up and you may not have a room available or MPCers will be too busy to attend.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Experiences don't have to be at the MPC. But they must be open to MPCers and you must be the organizer/creator of the experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Promote your experience, especially if it's outside the MPC space. Make a poster and put it on the bulletin board. Share it on Slack. You're competing against lots of other cool things. But people will show up if you do a good job and tell people about your experience before it begins!
			</p>
			<p>
				You should plan and think about your experiences in advance, but experiences are submitted as you go. Why?
			</p>
			<p>
				Speakers cancel. Changes in logistics happen. Better ideas arise. When you have a good experience ready, <a href="http://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BzxEk7u4UzLBX1JPazkxSHJGRkE/view?usp=sharing">submit this simple form</a> to the MPC for approval.
			</p>

			<h3>Milestone</h3>
			<h4>Let’s go find the monster under your bed ... and kill it</h4>
			<blockquote class="decor">
				I didn’t receive a formal education. I was educated in the cafes of Montevideo. There, I received my first lessons in the art of telling stories. Eduardo Galeano
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				One time when I was like five I climbed up to a tree house. When I looked down, I suddenly knew I was going to die and burst into tears. Except I didn’t. And it wasn’t even that high because some dude came and took me down. The point is, fear is mostly a perception. And while I could climb up, I couldn’t climb back down.
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image26.gif" alt="godzilla">
				<figcaption>
					Milestone Complete!
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				(Lame.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The Milestone is a special type of experience. The success of your semester depends on you overcoming one big fear.
			</p>
			<p>
				While MPCers design their two experiences for other students, the Milestone is designed for the student herself. Each term MPCers are responsible for one Milestone.
			</p>
			<p>
				You have to plan your Milestone in advance as part of your contract. There’s a section when you submit your contract to type it in.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your Milestone must stretch you beyond your comfort zone.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're afraid of public speaking, you should give a public lecture. If you've never gone rock climbing, you should go. If you've never been able to continue a habit for more than a week, you could publicly track your habit for five weeks. You could interview someone in a high-pressure situation, or publish something to a wider audience than ever before.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Milestone is your chance to grow the emotional and psychological skills that you need to be successful. Go slay that dragon.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="mentor">
			<h3>Mentors</h3>
			<h4>Your New Best Friend</h4>
			<p>
				Every course must have a mentor. Your mentor is responsible for grading your final evaluation. Only one mentor can grade your final evaluation.
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image09.gif" alt="jimmy kimmel drunk">
			</figure>
			<h4>
				You Have to Convince Mentors
			</h4>
			<p>
				We can make introductions, but you’re responsible for finding and confirming your mentor. You may need to be persuasive sometimes. Your ability to network and secure mentorships is a valuable life skill and part of your education.
			</p>
			<p>
				All mentors should be confirmed for your courses before you submit your Learning Contract. This means uploading a signed and complete mentor agreement form to the MPC for each of your classes.
			</p>
			<h4>Mentoring is Flexible</h4>
			<p>
				You control how much additional mentoring you need. You can contract with a mentor and negotiate a fee based on the amount of attention that you need. Schedule weekly check-ins, or not. Get lots of one-on-one time, or not.
			</p>
			<h4>Set Clear Expectations</h4>
			<p>
				Make sure to set clear expectations. Your mentor should know whether they are being paid and how much you will pay them. They should know when you intend to meet and how often. They should know what you are studying, when you will be finished with your project, and what that project will be. This should be obvious, but some people still don’t do these things. Don’t be like some people. Set clear expectations.
			</p>
			<h4>Start Early</h4>
			<p>
				Don't wait until the day before your contract is due to contact a mentor. Busy people can take a while to respond to emails. Contact them right away. It’s not our problem if your mentor doesn’t respond to you in time. Plan ahead.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="mentormeeting">
			<h3>Your First Mentor Meeting</h3>
			<h4>How to Tell Someone You Have a Brain-Crush on Them</h4>
			<p>
				It can be intimidating to ask someone to be your mentor. Don’t be afraid. Most people are flattered and excited when someone is interested in their work. You're so interested, in fact, that you want to work or learn with them and have them grade you on your work!
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image19.gif" alt="adventure time fire">
			</figure>
			<p>
				However, always maintain a professional attitude when you interact with your mentor. Mentors may be busy. And they have the power to fail your for the semester.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Here's a good way to approach a mentor:</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Send them an email</strong> explaining that you're a student at the MPC, a program that uses paid mentorships to grade students on their work
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Thank the mentor</strong> for their time
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Explain</strong> to them that a mentorship is not a significant time commitment. The student is in charge of their learning: mentors aren't expected to hold the student's hand through the course
				</p>
				<p>
					The mentors will give the student <strong>a grade</strong> at the end of the term
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Always be polite</strong> with the mentor
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Share the mentor agreement with them</strong>, which discusses payment and responsibilities
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Thank the mentor</strong> for their time, regardless of what they say!

			<h3>Sample Course Ideas</h3>
			<h4>Some ways to think about a T-Shaped Learning Contract</h4>
			<p>
				<p>
					A well-balanced Learning Contract might include a mix of time invested in:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Technical skills</strong> associated with what might become my area of concentration
				</p>
				<p>
					An <strong>exploration course</strong> to explore the basics of a new field, perhaps in collaboration with a classmate
				</p>
				<p>
					A course built around a <strong>professional opportunity</strong> like an internship or part-time job
			</p>
			<h3>Sample Learning Contract: Artistic Focus</h3>
			<p>
				Let’s say I’m studying to be a product designer.
				The courses I’ll put in my Learning Contract might look like this:
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image29.gif" alt="Basquiat">
				<figcaption>SIMULATION: You after a semester on this contract</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<h4>Product Design Methods [Technical Skills] -</h4>
				In this course I’ll take <a href="https://novoed.com/hcd-acumen">IDEO’s Human Centered Design Course</a>, as well as the course Product Design and Development that uses <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-783j-product-design-and-development-spring-2006/index.htm">MIT’s Open Courseware Materials.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the semester I’ll prototype a series of products until I submit a final form to my mentor for a grade.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Graphic Design [Technical Skills] -</h4>
				In this course I’ll audit a graphic design course at UFM’s Design School, and use the professor as my mentor. I’ll also read the textbook <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956?tag=duc08-21">Design for Hackers</a> and apply what I learn to a series of freelance graphic design jobs (at least 4) to build out my portfolio which I’ll host at <a href="http://behance.net/">Behance.net</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>History of Western Philosophy [Exploration Course] — </h4>
				I’ve always been interested in philosophy, though I don’t consider it my specialty! In this course I’ll read Bertrand Russell’s <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/History-Western-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell/dp/1416554777/">History of Western Philosophy</a> as well as watch a series of debates between prominent philosophers. I’ll do this course with a classmate who shares my interest. We’ll talk about our reading twice-per-week. I’ll write a 20 page philosophical mini-biography of my favorite philosopher at the end of the course.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>In The Studio [Professional Opportunity] —</h4> I’m really excited because this semester I was offered an internship at GuateGraphics, Inc. a design studio. I’ll be helping them at each step of the design process as they work with clients. At the end of the semester I’ll have my boss evaluate me on several metrics, which I've stated in my rubric. I’ll also ask for a letter of recommendation and update my portfolio.
			</p>
			<h3>Sample Learning Contract: Quantitative Focus</h3>
			<p>
				Here’s another sample for those interested in quantitative disciplines like science, math, or programming.

			<p>
				<h4>Multivariable Calculus [Technical Skills] —</h4> I’ll use my Fellows Fund to hire a private tutor to help me as I go through the textbook Multivariable Calculus. At the end, I’ll take a final exam that I found at MIT Open Courseware for multivariable calculus.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Learning Python [Technical Skills] —</h4> I’ll take Harvey Mudd College’s online course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs-all-introduction-computer-science-harveymuddx-cs005x#!">An Introduction to Computer Science with Python</a>. This course has a final programming project which I’ll use as my final evaluation to be graded by a programmer from UFM. I’ll also do all the exercises from <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>History [Exploration Course] —</h4> I’ve always loved art. I’ll be reading E.H. Gombrich’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Story-Art-E-H-Gombrich/dp/0714832472">Story of Art</a>, attending at least 10 events from Organización Para Las Artes at UFM and meeting with an art historian once a week, where they’ll assign me additional readings.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Business Basics [Professional Opportunity] —</h4> I’m thinking about starting a Math tutoring service when I graduate. This semester I’ll be helping a local entrepreneur manage his restaurant business so that I learn how it works.	I have to give a seminar on restructuring his business at the end of the semester and he’ll write me a letter of recommendation if I do well. I’ll also continue teaching the three high school students that I currently tutor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h4>Each of these summaries of a course has:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>A clear objective and final project</li>
					<li>A relevant tutor</li>
					<li>High quality materials</li>
					<li>A rigorous time and work commitment to fill my semester</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, every course needs:
				<ul>
					<li>A clear and formal course description</li>
					<li>A clearly defined final evaluation, which you’ll use to prove what you have learned</li>
					<li>A rubric for your final evaluation, signed by your mentor</li>
					<li>A mentor agreement, signed by your mentor</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>How to FAIL</h3>
			<h4>And what happens if you do</h4>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image00.gif" alt="poolfail">
			</figure>
			<p>
				Several things can cause failure of the Learning Contract.
				<ul>
					<li>Failure to complete final evaluations</li>
					<li>Failure to turn in grades, contracts, or mentor agreements by their due dates.</li>
					<li>If a mentor gives a "fail" grade in a pass/fail course<li>
					<li>If a mentor refuses to write you a letter of recommendation because you were so bad at your internship</li>
					<li>If a mentor gives a D or F in a letter grade course</li>
					<li>If, for some other reason, a mentor refuses to grade the student or terminates the mentorship before the course is over. (This does not include uncontrollable circumstances like the mentor becoming ill or having to end the mentorship for reasons that are not the student's responsibility)</li>
					<li>Doing something really stupid and dishonest like plagiarizing a paper or other cheating</li>
				</p>
				<p class="faq">
					What happens if I fail?
				</p>
				<p>
					You get a frighteningly formal email that looks like this:
					<figure class="group">
						<img src="images/image03.png" alt="email screenshot">

					Failure of the Learning Contract is failure of the term in the MPC. A failed term means that you forfeit your tuition for that term and will not be awarded UMAs for that contract.

					Most contract failure will occur at the start or end of the term. If you fail in the middle of a term, you may still come to the MPC and participate in activities. But your work will no longer count towards a Learning Contract.
				</p>
				<p>
					You must pass six terms to graduate from MPC.
				</p>
				<h3>Failure Sucks: Learn From It</h3>
				<p>
					If you fail a contract, consider reflecting on your goals and habits. Although the MPC will strictly enforce these failure conditions, we always offer support for those who wish to learn from failure.
				</p>
				<p class="faq">
					What about my other classes that I didn't fail?
				</p>
				<p>
					These courses will still appear on your transcript and can still be graded. But they will not be worth any UMAs. We do this so that students still have an incentive to finish the semester if they fail a course halfway through. Do a good job and you can still get good grades in the courses you didn't fail.
				</p>
				<p class="faq">
					What happens to my Fellows Funding?
				</p>
				<p>
					Failed courses are no longer eligible for Fellows Funding. We will subtract the cost of the course based on the number of courses that you have (ex. 25% of your budget if you fail one out of four courses).
				</p>
				<p class="faq">
					Do I have to repeat courses?
				</p>
				<p>
					If you fail a Bootcamp course, you have to retake it the following year. If you fail in the second or third year, you don't. Every Learning Contract is independent.

				<h3>Ending Your Semester</h3>
				<h4>How to Avoid a Nervous Breakdown</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>It’s the end of the semester. And this is what’s due:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>All of your final evaluations (given to your mentor for grading then returned to you and uploaded to your student file folder</li>
						<li>Two experiences in the MPC (uploaded to your student folder)</li>
						<li>One Milestone (uploaded to your student folder)</li>
						<li>Documentation of the stuff you did during the semester, dragged into your student folder (images, prototypes, computer code, photos, documents, whatever)</li>

				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to be :-D and not :’-( do this:
					Once your mentor has graded your final evaluation, you must get the signed rubric that you gave them at the start of the semester and upload it to your Student Folder.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					Once again (because no one ever gets this right their first try):
					You must give your project at the end of the semester to your mentor, along with the grading form you had them sign at the start
					Then you must get your Grading Form from the mentor once they’re done giving you a grade, and you upload it to your <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/folderview?id=0BzxEk7u4UzLBflM1VG9NS0dUdUNLNXZnMUhvMk5ZMlBERG5nem1FbFBubnA0UGZhYzA2NG8&usp=sharing">student folder.</a>

				<h3>WAIT!</h3>
				<h4>*dramatic interlude*</h4>
				<p>
					“But,” you say, “I want to write a TRULY AWESOME LEARNING CONTRACT because I’m the reincarnation of Michelangelo and Thomas Edison combined and the world needs my brilliance!!!!!11”
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes. Exactly. Of course you do!
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, you should know that TRULY AWESOME LEARNING CONTRACTS...
				</p>
				<h4>...do real work.</h4>
				<p>
					 Don't just write a paper that no one wants to read. Don't do work for no reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					Publish. Design. Get it out in the world. Get it in your portfolio. Get a job. Produce something. DO REAL WORK. You’ll thank yourself later.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MPC wants students to do projects that will enhance their professional portfolios and life rather than 'busy work'.
				</p>
				<h4>...incorporate your life.</h4>
				<p>
					By now you've heard it a thousand times: your life is your education. Working a part time job in advertising? Find a place for it in your contract. Picked up a couple freelancing gigs? Define clear outcomes and put it in your contract. Want to travel to Antarctica? Put it in your contract.
				</p>
				<h4>…includes lots of practice.</h4>
				<p>
					How do you get awesome at something? Practice.
				</h4>
				<p>
					How do you discover what you’re passionate about? That soul-searching candlelit lacto-Vegan yoga retreat in the Brazilian jungle sounds cool … but you should probably just go practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					(Then do the jungle thing because seriously that sounds cool).
				</p>
				<p>
					Practice not only makes you smarter, more fiercely creative, and better at your craft, but it allows you to fail safely and often. Practice new ideas and skills as much as you can during the course, so you have something solid by the end.
				</p>
				<p>
				Practice is absolutely indispensable for skills like math, physical stuff like dancing/sports, languages (including computer programming), and music.
				</p>
				<figure class="group">
					<img src="images/image04.gif" alt="surfer on fire">
					<figcaption>
						this guy totally practiced and so should you
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
				There is no other way. There is no shortcut. Anyone who tells you there's a shortcut is lying or selling you something. Your brain is a like a big magic sponge that absorbs what you put in it. So take care of your brain… with practice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although your final evaluation is the most important part of your Learning Contract academically, your time spent practicing and practice projects are the most important to your personal growth. Do yourself a favor and <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/11/07/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/">deliberately practice.</a>
			</p>
			<h4>… have concrete objectives.</h4>
			<p>
				"This semester I will become a better designer!"
				"This semester I'll learn how to program!"
				"This semester is all about my writing."
				<figure id="content-image">
					<img src="images/grumpycat.jpg" alt="grumpy cat">
				</figure>
				This gives you no way to see clearly if you've achieved anything! Pick concrete stuff that you can measure, understand, and objectively see if you’ve achieved.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will complete four paid design jobs as a freelancer before the end of the semester. I will complete FreeCodeAcademy's certification on front-end web design in HTMl, CSS, and JQuery. I will produce a book of essays of between 50-60 pages.
			</p>
			<figure id="content-image">
				<img src="images/yeskid.jpg" alt="yes kid">

			<p>
				Success and failure of these outcomes are crystal clear. MPC rejects contracts with vague goals and objectives.
			</p>
			<h4>… use good materials.</h4>
			<p>
				Spend time researching the materials that you'll use for your course. Even if you don't know the exact books or chapters you'll use, put a good starting point. You can always tweak the materials or add more later. Get yourself on a firm foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Staff, other MPCers, and people at UFM can help you find resources for your course if you're unsure. Basically all of human knowledge is just a search engine away!
			</p>
			<h4>… uses proper spelling and punctuation for course descriptions.</h4>
			<p>
				Course descriptions go into UFM's system of course management. They're tied to the courses you design and part of your transcript. So do a good job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use proper spelling and punctuation! You're not texting and this is not the grammatical holocaust of your Facebook inbox.
			</p>
			<p>
				Descriptions should not be fancy or too 'clever'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pretentious

			<h4>… treats Final Evaluations as an awesome deliverable project, not an airy fantasy.</h4>
			<p>
				Remember: final evaluations are a deliverable. Imagine it’s a project you’re expecting someone to pay for. Make your project clear. DO REAL WORK.

			<h4>… treats studying like exercise</h4>
			<p>
				Studying is basically exercise. High-intensity workouts where you focus intensely for short periods of time are best. Sitting on your computer vaguely reading while chatting on Facebook is worth way, way less than 2-4 hours of intense focused work.

			<h3>Boring Rules and Regulations ... That You Must Nonetheless Follow</h3>
			<h4>General Rules of UFM</h4>
			<p>
				Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/Reglamento_General">general rules Universidad Francisco Marroquín.</a> The most important rules for the MPC appear in sections XVI. and XVII.
			</p>
			<h4>Grade Point Averages and Academic Distinctions</h4>
			<p>
				To receive a grade point average, students in the MPC must have at least three courses (or a minimum of 80% of their courses if more than three are taken) evaluated by letter grade ('nota literal') every semester that they are in the MPC. This is a general rule of UFM. We do not do traditional academic rankings.
			</p>
			<h4>Graduation with Honors </h4>
			<p>
				Students may be recommended for graduation with honors by their Great Work panel. These votes are made on the day of the panel.
			</p>
			<figure class="group">
				<img src="images/image21.gif" alt="sherlock holmes">
			</figure>
			<h4>Amendments to Final Evaluations</h4>
			<p>
				Sometimes when you start a course, you think a particular final project will be the right fit. But after a few months of learning, some people realize that their final evaluation could be more meaningful or challenging. Just as the MPC allows for a dynamic process for you to learn, you can also upgrade your final evaluations
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				How does this work?
			</p>
			<p>
				Write up the proposed change to your final evaluation using a new Grading Rubric form.
				Get it approved by the mentor who will grade your course.
				Get it approved by MPC.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/image06.gif" alt="lazy dog">
				<figcaption>
					canine rendering of amendment that will not be approved
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Ambitious new ideas will be approved. For example:
			</p>
			<p>
				<blockquote class="content-quote">
					A different project of equal difficulty: I was going to write a 20 page paper, instead I'm going to organize a symposium at UFM.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="content-quote">
					The same project, but harder: I was going to paint 5 works, now I'm going to paint 10.
				</blockquote>
				Laziness will be rejected. Anything that is easier or an attempt to avoid the serious commitment you made in the contract.

			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<h4>for Confused MPCers</h4>
			<p class="faq">
				Can I take classes in other faculties at UFM?
			</p>
			<p>
				Yes – but because of how UFM is organized, you’ll have to pay twice. We know that sucks, but that’s just how it is. We don't have any control over that. Other faculties will ask for the cost of the course in their faculty and the MPC will charge for the credit toward your MPC degree.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you still want to do it the MPC will assign the grade that the outside faculty gives you when you’re done. So if you get a “B” in Architecture 101, that’s what will end up on your MPC transcript.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Are you for real? That sounds expensive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah dude, sorry. Remember that the MPC is not meant to recreate a traditional education where you sit in lectures and listen, which is what most other faculties offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				We recommend that you consider designing your own course, using materials from the faculty or other schools. Most schools publish the syllabus (the schedule and readings of their courses) online. For courses within UFM you may even be able to get the exact same professor as a mentor for your course if you approach them using the MPC model. Some professors are also flexible and will let you sit in their classes for free.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Why don’t we do lectures?
			</p>
			<p>
				Because lectures don’t work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don’t take our word for it. Here are <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828296/">actual scientists from the National Institute of Health</a> (who I assume wear white coats and thick glasses):
				<blockquote class="content-quote">
					We should actively work toward and welcome the demise of traditional passive lectures.
				</blockquote>
				Hardcore. Not only do these scientists say that lectures are terribly ineffective at teaching you, but we should work hard to kill them.
			</p>
			<p class="faq">
				Doesn’t the MPC control how I learn during the semester?
			</p>
			<p>
				No. We seriously don’t. You should put thought and careful attention into the materials, experiences, check-ins and other components of the courses that you design each Learning Contract.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, these sections in your contract will be for you and your mentor, not the MPC. Your commitments are non-negotiable, but your learning process is up to you. You are free to change the elements that you’ll use to learn during the semester.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do this because learning is a dynamic process. If the textbook you’re using is no good, or the video lectures are boring, change them.
			</p>
			<p>
				This also allows you to take advantage of opportunities that arise, such as a new internship that will teach you more than the reading and work process that you had planned. You can nest all of life’s surprises into your contract, so long as you still reach your goals. Make sure to track your progress and the changes you make in your portfolio!

<!--Part Four-->


<section id="part4">
	<h2>Part 4: Great Work and Graduation</h2>
	<h3>The End is Near!</h3>
	<div id="grad">
		<p>
			We want the MPC to prepare you for life beyond school. As a community for creative leaders, graduation requirements reflect our commitment to your long term work as a creator.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few years out of college, when most students are in their mid-20s, people already look more at what you've accomplished than at where you went to school. This doesn't mean that your credential doesn't matter. We want the MPC to provide both: a strong credential and a record of Great Work.
		</p>
		<h4>Declare your Degree Concentration</h4>
		<p>
			At the start of your final term, you declare your degree concentration. This is like choosing your 'major' in a traditional program, except you design it. A sample concentration might be, "Psychology and Education" or "Social Entrepreneurship". Your concentration must reflect your studies or it won't be approved. If you studied Medieval Literature, you can't declare a concentration in Quantum Physics!
		</p>
		<p>
			We highly recommend that you <a href="http://myroad.collegeboard.com/myroad/navigator.jsp?t=majors&i=index">use collegeboard.com</a> to select a concentration so that you select something that’s understandable to other institutions. Collegeboard offers a huge list of majors and minors from universities around the world. It's a good way to find an appropriate Concentration that doesn't sound too obscure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember, you need to be able to defend this title during your panel. So you need to pick something that applies to your course list and Great Work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to constraints on the physical degree that UFM offers, your Concentration must be short. And, even though you may not like all the elements in the mainstream of your field, it's better to choose a more general Concentration than something that others will see as weird.
		</p>
		<p>
			So don't choose: "21st Century Archaeological studies of Ancient Mayan Ruins". Just choose "Archaeology". You also can't use strange punctuation like "Science: Experiments in Motion -- and Other Physics". Just do "Physics."
		</p>
		<p>
			You want a concentration that clearly communicates your work and focus in the MPC. Keep it clear. Keep it simple.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="portfolio">
		<h4>Portfolio</h4>
		<p>
			In the long run, a portfolio of great creative work is more important than your degree. Your degree and the connections you get from the MPC will open doors and prepare you for graduate school or professional life. But eventually people want to see a strong record of work, not a credential.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want you to graduate with both.
		</p>
		<p>
			All new students admitted to the MPC are asked to make a portfolio. The portfolio and interview are the most important elements in our admission decision. This portfolio is the basis of the work you'll build over the program and show-off during Crits Day each semester.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not everything goes in a portfolio. Put stuff that you're proud of and that's relevant to your future customers/bosses/clients. Think of yourself as a brand – how do you want people to perceive you when they browse your portfolio? Portfolios may be on paper or online. Ideally, you should have a version of both.
		</p>
		<p>
			Portfolios help you get into graduate school and they can land you a good job. If you plan to start your own business or work as a freelancer, your portfolio is like an elaborate business card. Building a portfolio can be fun and it's worth it. The MPC can help. And don't forget that your peers are there for feedback too.
		</p>
		<p class="faq">
			How do I put my Great Work in my Learning Contract?
		</p>
		<p>
			When you begin your Great Work in the 3rd year, we expect you to take a lighter load in your extra classes.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should clearly incorporate your Great Work into your learning contract as a course. You're still responsible for your Milestone Challenge and experiences in the MPC.
		</p>
		<h4 class="warning">Procrastination Warning:</h4>
		<p>
			 The lighter load of the last semester is not an invitation to relax! It’s time to double down on your Great Work.
		</p>
		<p>
			A sample contract may look like this:
			<ul>
				<li>Course Built Around Development Steps of Great Work (5 UMAs)</li>
				<li>Course 1 to Support my Great Work (5 UMAs)</li>
				<li>Course 2 to Support my Great Work (5 UMAs)</li>
				<li>Course 3 to Support my Great Work or a Professional Opportunity after MPC (5 UMAs)</li>
				<li>Experiential Learning: Milestone and Experiences (5 UMAs)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			You might use your Milestone and experiences as a way to further or enhance your Great Work. Run a focus group for your new business. Do a public reading of your novel in the MPC. Test your app with fellow students. Run a dialogue on the tough creative problem you're facing.
		</p>
		<h4>Don’t Be Like Everyone Else</h4>
		<p>
				Your Great Work is meant to take you to success beyond the MPC. Students in traditional college programs face a common problem: they graduate with a degree and suddenly find themselves out in the real world with no idea what to do. The Great Work is how the MPC helps students avoid this cruel fate.
		</p>
		<p>
				Your Great Work should demonstrate your own development as a creative leader. It's the culmination of your work in the MPC.
		</p>
		<p>
				Your Great Work should be clearly ambitious and show leadership. Getting a job may be part of your Great Work, but it can't be the whole thing. You need to prove that you are capable of going your own way, even if that means developing something within an existing business or organization.
		</p>
		<p>
				You can do your Great Work with others in the MPC, such as founding a business together – but everyone has to be involved. No freeriders.
		</p>
		<p>
				Take advantage of the Learning Contract as a tool to structure your Great Work. The landmarks you set in your course can keep you on track as you develop your project (for example, "Publish Chapter 1", "Sell one unit of my product" etc).
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="panel">
		<h3>Great Work Panel</h3>
		<p>
				The Great Work panel is how the MPC evaluates your Great Work and the concentration you define for your degree. It's an hour-long discussion with a jury of mentors, peers, or experts in the area of your interest. The Great Work Panel is a more intense version of the interview panel that evaluates students for admission.
				The panel evaluates both the student's knowledge of their degree concentration and their progress of their Great Work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ambitious Great Works are unlikely to be finished by the end of the third year. The panel does not expect the student to have completed everything, but to demonstrate their hard work, their progress, and share the lessons they have learned.
		</p>
		<p>
			Students are also expected to demonstrate significant knowledge in the field of their concentration. For example, a student who has studied education and psychology should be able to discuss major ideas in both fields with sophistication and ease.
		</p>
		<h4>Panel Makeup</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>The panel is defined as follows:
				<li>A panelist chosen by the MPC</li>
				<li>A panelist chosen by the student (they can not be a family member or close friend)</li>
				<li>A panelist mutually agreed upon by both student and MPC</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Panel Verdict</h4>
		<p>
			The verdict of the panel must be unanimous for the student to pass.

		</p>
		<p class="faq">
			What steps do I need to follow?
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Turn in your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5MA0e_pTVfRq9xSMLcI7fVWDk9ezZ8NGZ7XoXos5ag/edit">GW Summary</a> before the deadline by saving it to your <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/folderview?id=0BzxEk7u4UzLBflM1VG9NS0dUdUNLNXZnMUhvMk5ZMlBERG5nem1FbFBubnA0UGZhYzA2NG8&usp=sharing">student file.</a></li>
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Let us know through Slack. Slots are saved according to the order we receive the summaries (first students to turn them in get the slot of their chosen date).
		</p>
		<p>
			3. Choose one panelist and negotiate a second one with the MPC team. You can approach us to do this but take note that you should establish your judges before the deadline. The third judge will be chosen entirely by the MPC, usually representing the MPC Advisory Board. A staff member will also be on your panel and may ask questions, but does not have voting rights.
		</p>
		<p>
			4. MPC will send an official invite to the chosen panelist and set them up for your panel according to your proposed date. For the MPC team this implies a lot of organization so we ask for your punctuality in turning in your GW Summary. The sooner the better.
		</p>
		<p>
			5. Start organizing everything you need for your panel. You are in charge of the experience you will offer the panelists (for example: send complementary documents, ask us to reserve a classroom, film your panel, bring snacks or any other material that you need, etc).
		</p>
		<p>
			6. Be prepared to defend your Great Work, the ideas in your Concentration Defense essay, and to present a brief overview of your learning journey and portfolio. Panelists will have a copy of your transcripts and might ask questions related to your courses.
		</p>
		<p>
			7. Enjoy your Great Work Panel day!
		</p>
		<p class="faq">
			How does the time work during the panel?
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
			Time is distributed as follows:
				<li>10 minutes to present your portfolio/learning journey</li>
				<li>20 minutes to defend your concentration</li>
				<li>30 minutes to question, criticize, and discuss with the panelists</li>
				<li>The last 10 minutes are used to deliberate and present the verdict</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="faq">
			How will I be evaluated?
		</p>
		<p>
			A single vote form will be given to the panelists through which they will deliver the final verdict:
				Pass
				Revise and Resubmit
				Fail
		</p>
		<p>
			These read as follows:
			<blockquote class="content-quote">
				PASS: The student has achieved a major creative work of professional quality and demonstrates thorough knowledge of their area of concentration.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="content-quote">
				REVISE AND RESUBMIT: The student must improve their project and prepare a new presentation for the panel that shows a higher level of mastery in their field and/or a more developed Great Work.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="content-quote">
				FAIL: The student has not shown adequate knowledge of their field or has an underdeveloped, sloppy, or amateur project. Students that fail must take an additional semester to learn more, develop their project, and try again.
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: Panelists will agree on one final vote. Due to the high diversity of projects and interests, there is no pre-defined standard of evaluation. The role of the judge will be based on their own professional standards of quality. Panelists are asked to evaluate your knowledge in the field of concentration and the level of development of your Great Work.

		<h3>Failure of the Great Work Panel</h3>
		<p>
			If a student receives a revise and resubmit or fail on the Great Work Panel, the panel will talk with the student about what must be improved. The panel and student will devise a future date to attempt the panel again when the student has made more progress. Students cannot graduate until they pass their Great Work Panel.
