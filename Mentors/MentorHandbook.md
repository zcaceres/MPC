#MPC Mentor Handbook

##SPANISH TRANSLATION NEEDED

“All the world is my school and all humanity is my teacher.” - George Mitchell

####The Mentor
You've been asked to be a mentor. The mentor is a key part of this student's education. Mentoring for the MPC is a paid opportunity. Plus, mentoring can be a lot of fun. Before you make your decision whether to become an MPC mentor, please read this brief guide.

####Brief Overview of the MPC
The MPC is a non-traditional university program focused on creative development and self-directed learning. We're based at Universidad Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala City.

Students in the MPC design their own courses. Then, students find a mentor with relevant skills to evaluate their progress in the course. Students spend three years developing their own degree and then pursue a Great Work – a crowning creative achievement that takes them to success beyond the MPC.

###Payment
We respect the value of your time. The MPC pays mentors from outside UFM an honorarium of Q450 per month for each student that they mentor.

###Expectations
The mentor is not a teacher. <b>You are not expected to sit down and spend hours 'teaching' a student how to do their work.</b> Our students are learning how to lead their own education. The role of a mentor is as an advisor and evaluator.

Here's what we ask of a mentor:

####Feedback Meetings
We ask that you meet at least twice per month with the student to give them feedback. Students should schedule these meetings at your convenience.

This can be done in person, or remotely with an online application like Skype. Typical meetings are between 30-minutes to an hour. During the meeting, students should bring questions and work to share with you.

Take this time to critique students' work, share with them areas where they can improve, and impart lessons that are valuable for their education. Students should show progress between each meeting. Think of the feedback meeting as your chance to help steer the student in the right direction as they return to independent work.

####Grading
You will be responsible for the final grade that a student receives in this course. This grade will go on their university transcript. 

We set high standards for our students. Please grade honestly and don't be afraid to fail or penalize a student who has not made sufficient progress during the term.

####Beyond the Mentorship
You are more than welcome to share more time with the student than the feedback meetings or to invite them to professional events or other experiences that may contribute to their education or professional life.

Students are always searching for professional experence. If you are impressed with the student, consider whether they may bring value to your own projects. Students are required to fulfill at least one professional internship during their time in the MPC. During their internship, students can help you in your business, at events, or be capable assistants for research or other projects. If you want to arrange an internship with the student, please contact them.
