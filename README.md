#MPC Policies and Handbooks
============
Policies, protocols, and organization for the Michael Polanyi College at Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n. We know this is an 'ugly' place to put documents, but it's the best version-control software out there.

The purpose of this repo is to collect all major internal components of the MPC model.

Github allows all collaborators to change rules and policies for the MPC. It allows for an on-going conversation and evolution of the model. 

<b>All changes should be justified by the author using the commit changes option at the bottom of each document.</b>
