MPC-handbook
============

Policies, protocols, and organization for the Michael Polanyi College at Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n.

The purpose of this repo is to collect all major components of the MPC model. First we will migrate our existing documents. Then we will open these documents to collaboration by students and staff using Github's technology.

Github allows all collaborators to change rules and policies for the MPC. It allows for an on-going conversation and evolution of the model. All changes should be justified by the author
