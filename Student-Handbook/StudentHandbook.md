##Mindset
The MPC is built on the <i>growth mindset</i>. Put simply, it means that our program focuses on habits of learning rather than a curriculum built on textbooks or lectures. Important habits include: risk taking, a willingness to fail, perserverence, lifelong learning, and self-direction.

Someone with a 'growth mindset' believes that talents and skills can be cultivated and learned. Indeed, they must be – if the learner wants to become great. So the person with a growth mindset focuses on hard work, good habits, and rising to meet new challenges.

The opposite of a growth mindset is a 'fixed mindset'. People with this mindset believe that their intelligence, skills, or personality traits are set for life. People with fixed mindsets avoid challenge and risk, because it threatens their ego and identity as a "smart" or "skilled" person. 

Those with a growth mindset treat life as a constant adventure and every new challenge as a chance to learn and grow. The MPC gives students a chance to change their mindset and become lifelong learners.

Read more about Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck's pioneering work in her book <i>Mindset</i>. [Here's a summary](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).

##What do you need for the MPC?

<b>A well-functioning modern laptop</b>
Your laptop is an indispensible part of your education. Consider it an investment in your future. Most people use Macbooks in  the MPC, but PCs are fine too. However, if you use a PC, it's your responsibility to deal with problems like computer viruses. We don't recommend 'netbooks' or Macbook Airs. They are usually not powerful enough, don't include CD/DVD drive, and have occasional hardware problems.

What about books?
Most readings can be found digitally. We'll rarely ask for you to buy physical copies of books, although you are free to do so if you prefer to read that way. A lot of MPCers are bibliophiles and know tons of books. Ask them if you need something to read, or check out our lending library.

Software?
We recommend Microsoft Office and design programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. These are not absolutely necessary since Google Docs exists. But they may come in handy.

Creative materials?
If you want to spend your time working on a craft that requires lots of materials such as painting, you are responsible for those materials. The MPC does have some materials available. These are shared and you can't always count on their availability. Bring what you need. <b>If you don't want people to use your stuff, make sure you CLEARLY label what's yours.</b> Use a locker. We're a trustworthy bunch, but it's better to avoid any problems.

##MPChat with Slack
When you enroll in the MPC, we'll invite you to our private online chatroom. We use a platform called Slack.

Slack is divided into independent chat rooms called channels. Most of the channels should be pretty obvious. Put cool stuff for others in "#share", put experiences in "#experiences", and put lolcats in "#random". Please be respectful of others on Slack.

<b>It is your responsibility to check Slack regularly so that you don't miss important announcements.</b>

##Hours and the MPC Space
The MPC space at UFM is open from 7:00 to 9:00pm, Monday through Friday. 

As a student of the MPC, you have exclusive access to this space. You are always welcome. Please be respectful of others and the resources of the MPC.

##Visitors Policy
Visitors are welcome in the MPC if they are part of the student's work. Bring your co-founder, your mentor, your bandmate. Every visitor must be sponsored by a student. The student will be held responsible for the visitor's behavior. Visitors must be respectful of MPCers who are doing work. What we want to avoid is random visitors abusing MPC materials or filling the MPC space and ruining the experience for students. Visitors can be asked to leave at any time by students or MPC staff if they are disruptive.

<b>MPC Schedule</b>
Bootcamp courses are scheduled for each subject cycle. We don't usually schedule things into the evening because we believe you need time with friends, family, loved ones, and to do other activities. However, we may have fun stuff like movie nights sometimes. These will usually be optional.

Aside from Bootcamp, the MPC does not have an official daily schedule. The schedule emerges from the courses and experiences designed by MPCers. Consult the MPC calendar to find regular seminars, experiences, student-led courses, dialogues with visitors, and other events.

<b>It's important to check Slack, your email, and your calendar regularly.</b>

##Bootcamp
Year one is Learning Bootcamp. It's a chance to explore and try out different subjects and methods of learning.

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing

As you master these skills, you'll learn the core ideas of ten subjects.

1. Philosophy
2. Biology and Evolution
3. Psychology
4. Economics, Finance and Money
5. Political Science, Law and Sociology
6. Music and Drama
7. History and Literature
8. Art, Design, and Cultural Evolution
9. Technology
10. Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Why did we choose these subjects? 
Because they're the most important fields for the development of creative individuals. After Bootcamp, you should understand the main ideas of each field. You won't yet be an expert. That's ok! Bootcamp is to help you find direction, not make you into a professor. You'll be ready to decide which areas you want to study more deeply.

What are the "course texts"?
Each subject has texts defined by the subject tutor. Don't worry, the MPC will provide you with digital copies.

Here's important texts for understanding the MPC in general.

##How does Bootcamp Work?
Bootcamp is a co-designed experience between tutors and Bootcampers (first-year MPC students). Before each bootcamp begins, you'll have an initial meeting with the tutor. This meeting is a design workshop. During the workshop, you'll get to design the full course for the subject. The MPC provides you with materials to help, but you and the tutor are responsible for deciding on activities, schedules, and also for the final evaluation of the course.

How will you learn the subjects? 
Dialogues with experts, experiential learning, and independent reading and writing. The mix is up to you.

Here are the main components of the Bootcamp:
1. Core Dialogues
2. Experiential Learning Days
3. Writer's Studio
4. Bootcamp Learning Contracts
5. MPCafé Performances

The first step to success is showing up. <b>All components are mandatory for Bootcampers</b>

###Core Dialogues
Students have focused dialogues about the main ideas of the subject. <b>You must do your reading before these dialogues begin or you will be lost.</b> Occasionally there will be other days devoted to core ideas. These conversations are intense and cover a lot of material, so get a good night's sleep.

####Bootcamp Grades
<b>Grading During Bootcamp</b>
Student’s grades are calculated for each subject as follows:

One Third: MPCafé Performance
One Third: Subject Review or Essay
One Third: Course Final Evaluation (designed and agreed to by Tutor and Students)

We use participatory grading:
Students receive a grade from peers on their writing. 
Students receive a grade from the MPCafé crowd.

Final evaluations are graded according to the rubric set when the course is initially designed.

####Final Evaluation Policy for Bootcamp

The final evaluation policy is as follows:
If students disagree about a final evaluation, they may design their own as a sub-group of the bootcamp. Evaluations are never individual – there must be at least two people for any form of final evaluation. The tutor + MPC must also agree to the change.

<b>Rubrics</b>
<b>MPCafé</b>
The rubric is [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xxg8qk_nncICeY358bfl20tygGwH5Q1viYv_USdAqkE/edit?usp=sharing).

Student did not do a performance. (0/10)

Essay or Book Review
Use Writer’s Studio Rubric

Student did not turn in an essay. (0/10)

Peer-to-Peer Feedback on Dialogues
Students should give and receive peer-to-peer feedback about their participation dialogues. Encourage the quiet people to speak up. Make sure one or two participants don't dominate the entire conversation.

<b>Final Averages</b>
Final Averages
Each evaluation operates on a scale of 1–10. Final scores for all three elements are averaged and students receive a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) according to the outcome.
Letter Grade

F: 1 - 1.9
D: 2 - 4.5
C: 4.5 - 6.4
B: 6.5 - 8.4
A: 8.5 - 10

###Writer's Studio
Good writing is clear thinking made visible. Written communication is especially key to the digital age.

Whatever path you take, you need to write well. The MPC Writer's Studio is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. Written assignments may be a book review or an essay. WE recommend that if you are uncomfortable making strong arguments through writing that you begin with a book review. Book reviews are less critical and more structured. Essays are freer and include more of your voice. You graduate to the freedom of the essay through rigorous practice of the review.

Students learn writing in a workshop environment throughout the Bootcamp. By the second half of the year, students are expected to become more critical and write lengthier, more personal essay on their reading.

#####Book Reviews
Students are responsible for producing a high-quality 1000-2000 word review or essay each subject cycle.

[Here's the rubric for book reviews and some samples of good work.](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2dG1jUF9PR2xkN3M/view?usp=sharing)

#####Essay
Essays follow a similar format to book reviews. But essays offer greater freedom than the review. There is no page limit to the essay. It is expected to be as concise as possible while still conveying the most important information on their topic. You can include references to other readings and your own opinions. Think of it as an engaging chapter in a book. Make it clear. Make it entertaining. Make it professional.

###Writer's Workshop Schedule
The Workshop usually follows a simple format.
15 minutes - Warm-up. During this time you'll see examples of good writing or do a written exercise.
30 minutes - Sprint. Write about anything, including your MPC work if you wish. No talking. No phones. No distractions.
45 minutes - Prepare for publication, editing, peer review. Time to talk to the tutor one on one, to peer review, and edit.

<b>At the end of each Writer's Workshop, you will publish your work on Medium.</b>

###Publication Requirements
Publishing your work from Bootcamp is mandatory. At the end of each Writer's Workshop, you click publish. Your book review for each subject will also be published.

All students in Bootcamp must publish. <b>There are no exceptions.</b>

By default, students publish on Medium ([click here](https://medium.com/mpc-reads/the-mpc-guide-to-stress-free-publishing-on-medium-7acd451fcd29) for a how-to guide!). We have a shared Medium collection that students can use to publish together. However, if you have a preferred or better outlet for your work, you can use that too. You still need to upload your work on Medium (you can keep it private), so that your fellow Bootcampers can do peer grading.

In summary:
1. You must post your work on Medium so that students can do peer grading. 
2. If Harvard Business Review calls and you have a chance to publish elsewhere, then you can use that one and keep your Medium upload private.
3. Everyone must publish.

The MPC will not assign grades for Bootcamp unless the student has published their work.

####Help! I need structure to write!
Students may work on any writing during the Writer's Workshop. For students who want a more structured approach, you can follow this process:

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction
Read preface, introduction, and at least the first chapter of the book. 
Read liner notes and any commentary on the back cover. 
Scan or speed-read the final chapter or conclusion. 

Look for material to include in your intro. Around the middle of the first week, write your introduction—i.e., your first paragraph — focusing on the overarching importance or uniqueness of the book, any controversy it might stir, the author’s reputation, etc.

Bring to the workshop:
1. Your introduction (a strong first paragraph)

Now get reading! You probably should schedule clear reading goals so you finish on-time. Talk to a coach or co-learner if you need help with this.

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters
Finish your book this week. Coordinate your notes and start to synthesize them into paragraph-length summaries of each chapter. Don't just regurgitate. Have some style. Remember that one short, powerful quote is worth more than ten huge block quotes. 

Bring this to the workshop:
1. An outline of your review
2. A first draft of the paragraphs devoted to chapter summaries
3. A first draft of the final paragraph where you offer your own opinion of the book

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review
Time for some serious editing. We'll break up into groups of 2-3 for peer review. Read your work out loud to the reviewers, who take notes and give feedback. Listen to how your writing sounds as you speak it. If it sounds confusing or dumb when it's said – it's bad writing.

Bring this to the peer review workshop:
1. Your complete first draft

[Here's a checklist for peer review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InB9QeJ0qQxazB9ND8TT6mXFqtKxAoMmcnUwBKAMCRo/edit?usp=sharing)

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

Bring this to your consult with a Writing Tutor:
1. Your second draft (which must include feedback from peer review)

[Here's a checklist for final draft review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1do1op-_3iTYL1FXMEXacLEHzs77webrJmNp7RRZn5Tw/edit?usp=sharing)

[Here's a checklist of all the steps presented here, week-by-week.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hR9BH3zlUSN8mUYpFovp9n8UW7i5afjCumm3paaYN0/edit?usp=sharing)

#####Peer Grading
Follow [this guide](https://medium.com/mpc-reads/the-mpc-guide-to-mpcaf%C3%A9-and-stress-free-publishing-on-medium-9b1d12b33b11) to understand peer-grading.

###MPCafé
MPCafé is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. Bootcampers give their MPCafé performances. This day tests your ability to communicate and perform. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Essays or book reviews are due on MPCafé.

On MPCafé, we open the program to the public. We convert the MPC into a café. Your parents might show up. Students are expected to demonstrate their mastery of their research that month in a creative format. 

MPCafé is mostly for Bootcampers. Students in their second and third years can also show their work on MPCafé. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.

Read a [complete guide to MPCafé here](https://medium.com/mpc-reads/the-mpc-guide-to-mpcaf%C3%A9-and-stress-free-publishing-on-medium-9b1d12b33b11).

####Public Speaking at MPCafé
Public speaking is a core skill of life, and of the MPC. MPCafé is practice. Writing and public speaking serve different purposes. [Read this essay to understand why](http://paulgraham.com/speak.html). Put simply, writing generates, clarifies, and organizes ideas. Speaking convinces, entertains, and inspires action. A creator needs both.

Your book review or essay should be a clean and accurate exposition of your ideas and reading. But your MPCafé presentation is your chance to engage more creatively with the ideas. These are not book reports or 'class presentations' like middle school. Get critical with the ideas. Put your own spin on them. Express an argument, point out something insightful or strange.

By default, everyone gives a 5-7 minute TED-talk style lecture on the subject. But MPCafé has an open format. You can do nearly anything you want. You have to stand in front of the crowd will all eyes on you. But what you do is up to you.

Example MPCafé presentations might include:
1. A theatrical monologue or dialogue
2. A song about the ideas
3. Sculpture or art on the subject theme
4. A video that you made
5. A timed debate with a classmate
6. A live experiment

All formats must include a public-speaking component. Before you perform your song, give some remarks about why you wrote it. Explain your art. Frame the scene.

You can do it alone, or you can work with others. Everyone needs a main role, though. No freeloaders.

<b>Whatever format you choose, your presentation is expected to be strong and professional. Remember, you'll have a real audience.</b>

You'll be graded by the audience and the MPC for your work on MPCafé. Have fun, but work hard.

> “Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person.” ― Immanuel Kant

###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and writing. Bootcamp courses also include experiences to enhance your learning. For example, in psychology you may have to go out and sell products using persuasion techniques. Or perhaps we'll visit real biologist's lab during biology. We'll watch films and complete workshops.

Experiential learning will sometimes take you outside the MPC. Come prepared with whatever you need that day (jacket, wallet, phone, etc.)

###MPC Group Excursions
Each semester we organize at least one trip for the whole program. These are opportunities to adventure, learn, and see new places. Trips typically have themes and we assign readings and talk together when we reach our destination. During the trips time is mostly unstructured, so everyone has a chance to experience the destination.

We plan these trips in advance. <b>If you confirm your attendance and then cancel at the last minute we will bill you the cost of your trip.</b> This is the same as making an airline reservation.

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
During Bootcamp, we encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. This software is the backbone of the second and third year. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will be held accountable for their learning contracts, but the courses they design will not appear on their transcript.

In later years, you'll design courses that last for a full term. During bootcamp, students design a new mini-course every six weeks. Bootcampers are also encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students and seminars led by coaches. Otherwise, focus on your Bootcamp work.

For Spring 2015 the dates for these mini-contracts are:
January 19 – March 2
March 2 - April 6
April 6 - May 18

<b>The role of Learning Contracts during Bootcamp is to discover what kind of learner you are.</b> Do you work well with online courses? Or should you go find a job or internship to practice your skills? Do you learn best through listening, or perhaps reading? Bootcamp is your chance to discover your learning style at almost no-risk. Work hard on this because, once the second year starts, there's no going back on your contracts.

##First Year Checklist
At least One Experience provided to the MPC per term
Three Non-Credit Learning Contracts per term
Passed All Bootcamp Courses (at least a C)

##The Second and Third Years – MPC Fellowship
####MPC Fellows
In the second and third years, MPC students become Fellows with more responsibility but also special privileges.

Fellows design their entire semester through Learning Contracts (explained below). Fellows also receive Fellowship Funding (explained below). Fellows have no set hours or attendance policy. They may travel, work, research, and do any other activities that contribute to their education. The MPC organizes special seminars, workshops, dinners, and excursions exclusively for fellows.

####Philosophy of the Learning Contract 
Most schools ask you to make a choice: are you learning academics (‘education’), or are you pursuing professional work (‘job’)? This is a false choice.

Creative leaders make no difference between professional and academic life. Constant learning is how you become a better professional. But life is the ultimate learning experience: hard work and the pursuit of real-world projects gives your education substance. There should be no difference between your professional and academic life.

The Learning Contract allows nearly anything to become part of your education. Use the contract to design courses to support your work, or to put your studies into action through an entrepreneurial project of your own.

In the MPC, education is all cultivating these habits. Read more about [why we use Learning Contracts here.](https://medium.com/mpc-reads/education-is-about-habits-a27c22bc2c56)

####Making a Learning Contract
The MPC can help you if you're unsure about how to structure a learning contract. Other MPCers and Residents can also help you if you need it.

###How many Courses do I make?
Students can make from three to six courses per term. This is to prevent your transcript from showing too many tiny courses, or one huge course.

Everything that you want to accomplish should be prepared as part of these three to six courses. Remember that a course could have multiple components that you can fill with a variety of projects or activities.

###Fellows Fund
The Fellows Fund is a personal fund that students use to secure mentors, manage their courses, and invest in their future as the creator of their own education. The Future Fund is entirely yours to manage. The MPC will not tell you how to spend it.

#####Why Fellows Fund?
Fellows Fund allows greater flexibility when designing a course together. It allows you to invest in your education over time. It allows you to pursue free mentorships, or secure expensive mentors.

Most importantly, it puts you in the driver’s seat of your own education. You have to decide how best to spend your funds. The best way to learn how to manage money is to manage your own.

Use your money wisely. If you blow it all on useless stuff, the <b>MPC will not pay your mentors apart from the money allotted for your Fellows Fund.</b> Keep a good account of your funds.

#####How does Fellows Fund work?
1. As you plan your contract, consider costs for each course.
2. After you turn in your final contract and all mentor agreement forms, the MPC begins to fill your Fellows Fund (Q7200 per term, dispersed in monthly increments). This happens every semester in the second and third years.
3. The transfer will go directly to your bank account.
4. Your Fellows Fund should cover:
Materials you need for your course (books, lab materials, subscriptions to online courses, etc.)
Mentors
Anything else that you need to have an awesome term
5. For each course, you need to negotiate a payment for your mentor (or convince them to volunteer). Remember that UFM mentors can help for free. We’ll still need a mentor agreement form for every course. But you set the price. The flexibility of the Fellows Fund means that you can get a mentor to work for free, or you could spend your entire budget on a high-profile mentor. Fellows Fund replaces the old process of mentor payments.
6. We will provide you with a standard mentor agreement to contract with your tutor. This agreement will be between you and the tutor. You are responsible for securing these agreements and for paying the mentor from your fund. 
7. You can use your Fellows Fund for any other expenses that you have while you execute your contract.
For shared courses, students should agree beforehand who will pay for what. Students can pledge a set amount to their shared course. It’s your job to negotiate with your peers.
8. At the end of the semester, during Portfolio Week, everyone will share their remaining balance and talk about how they managed their money.

#####Does the Fellows Fund Expire at the end of the term?
No. Need to travel for an internship? Need seed funding for your Great Work? That means that you can save up money to invest in something bigger later.

As always, the MPC can help suggest mentors and offer a letter of introduction about the program and your studies.

#####Fines and Fellow's Fund
If a student is late turning in forms or other important deadlines, the MPC will deduct fines from your Fellow's Fund each day something is late.

You will not receive your Fellows Fund until:
1. You submit an approved Learning Contract
2. You submit all your confirmed mentor agreements
3. You are solvent with the MPC/UFM

#####Help! I don’t have a bank account.
Managing your own finances is an important part of your independence! So go get a bank account. You can open one right here at UFM through the Banco Industrial branch below the MPC. You’ll need to share your bank account data with the MPC so we can make the transfer.

#####Fellows Fund Commitment Contracts at the MPC
Have trouble forming a habit or worried that you’ll flake on a commitment? Write a commitment contract with the MPC. These are small agreements where you pledge money to do a task (lose ten pounds by March, read five books by June). Bring your contract and the cash you want to pledge to the MPC. We will hold the money. If you satisfy the commitment, you get the money back. If you don’t, you forfeit the money to the MPC which will use it to improve the space.

###Can all my classes be open?
No. You can't join only open courses. You need at least one 'personal' course. Why? Because of how UFM's UMA system works. But more importantly, you shouldn't be only freeriding on the course designs of other students. Take the material of other courses and use it to make something of your own.

###How do I put my Great Work in my Learning Contract?
Read the section on the Great Work below.

###Can I take classes in other faculties at UFM? 
Yes. But because of how UFM is organized, you’ll have to pay twice. Other faculties will ask for the cost of the course in their faculty and the MPC will charge for the credit toward your MPC degree. For grades in these courses, the MPC will assign the grade that the outside faculty gives you. So if you get a “B” in Architecture 101, that’s what will end up on your MPC transcript.

###But that sounds expensive. 
Yes, it can be. Remember that the MPC is not meant to recreate a traditional educational experience, which is what most other faculties offer. Consider designing your own course, using materials from the faculty or other schools. Most schools publish the syllabus (the schedule and readings of their courses) online. You may even be able to get the exact same professor as a mentor for your course if you approach them using the MPC model. Some professors are also flexible and will let you sit in their classes for free.

##Strategies for an Awesome Learning Contract
Yes, the Learning Contract gives the MPC gets the information it needs to make a transcript from your work. But its main role is as a tool to create habits and structure goals.

Learning Contracts let you ground your ideas in a concrete strategy. We all struggle with commitment. I want to paint, to play guitar, to learn German, to study economics, whatever. Curious people want to do a lot. Learning Contracts force you to ground your aspirations in real work.

####Make a Draft
Make a draft of your contract on paper or in a program like Microsoft Word. You can also make one by hand using our Learning Contract Canvas. Put all the messy stuff in this draft and then refine it to a final form. When it's ready, then you can easily submit it to the MPC through our online form. This also gives you a backup in case something goes wrong when you submit your contract online!

###Start Early with Mentors
Don't wait until the day before your contract is due to contact a mentor. Busy people can take a while to respond to emails. Contact them right away.

###Start Thinking Early, too
You can start to design a contract at any time, not just in the weeks provided by the MPC. Keep an ongoing journal of your goals and aspirations. Save material that might be useful in a future course. If you procrastinate, your contract won't be the best it could be.

####Elements of a Good Course
<b>Strategy = Constant Practice</b>
Practice makes perfect. Do your failing early and often. Practice new ideas and skills as much as you can during the course, so you have something solid by the end. This is especially important for skills like math, languages, and music. This goes under the "strategy" section. Besides your final evaluation, strategy may be the most important part of your courses.

<b>Concrete Outcomes/Metrics</b>
Bad outcome: "I will become a better designer." (This doesn't really tell you if you've achieved the goal!) Good outcome: "I will complete four paid design jobs as a freelancer before the end of the semester." Success and failure of this outcome is crystal clear.

<b>Start with Good Materials</b>
Spend some time researching the materials that you'll use for your course. Even if you don't know the exact books or chapters you'll use, put a good starting point. You can always tweak the materials or add more later. Get yourself on a firm foundation. Staff, other MPCers, and people at UFM can help you find resources for your course if you're unsure. Most resources are just a Google search away!

<b>Clear Final Evaluation</b>
All courses must have a final evaluation. Your final evaluation needs a due date and obvious criteria for success.

Bad: "I'll write a paper on Shakespeare."
Good: "I'll write a 10,000 word paper with academic citations on Shakespeare's relationship to rap music."

Bad: "I'll record a song."
Good: "I'll record a song of at least 3 minutes with multiple tracks and publish it on my Soundcloud."

Don't just write a paper that no one wants to read. Don't do work for no reason. Publish. Design. Get it out in the world. Get it in your portfolio. Do real work. You'll thank yourself later. We encourage students to do projects that will enhance their professional portfolios and life rather than 'busy work'.

<b>Incorporate your Life</b>
There doesn't need to be any difference between your professional/work life and your academic/student life. Working a part time job in advertising? Find a place for it in your contract. Picked up a couple freelancing gigs? Define clear outcomes and put it in your contract.

####Does the MPC control my learning process?
No. Learning is a dynamic process. If the textbook you're using is no good, or the video lectures are boring, change them. This also allows you to take advantage of opporutnities that arise, such as a new internship that will teach you more than the reading and work process that you had planned. You can nest all of life's wonderful surprises into your contract, so long as you still reach your goals. Make sure to track your progress and the changes you make in your portfolio!

####Writing a Good Course Description
Course descriptions go into UFM's system of course management. They're tied to the courses you design. If someone wants to know what your class was about, they can access this description. So make it good!

Descriptions should not be fancy or too 'clever'. Just be simple and clear. Remember, this is just for a transcript so it doesn't need to be fine art.

Bad description: "The world of cosmology is full of the mystery of the ether. Many great minds have pondered our place in the cosmos for millennia! We will interrogate the deepest cosmic truths to obtain spiritual enlightenment."

Good description: "In this course, we survey the cosmological theories of Bohm, Einstein, and Hawking. Students will read primary texts from each of these thinkers and complete a research project of their own in the theory of cosmology."

###Amendments to Final Evaluations
Sometimes when you start a course, you think a particular final project will be the right fit. But after a few months of learning, some people realize that their final evaluation could be more meaningful or challenging.

Just as the MPC allows for a dynamic process for you to learn, you can also upgrade your final evaluations. How does this work? Write up the proposed change to your final evaluation. Then it must be approved by the mentor who will grade and the MPC. That's it!

<b>What will be approved:</b>
A different project of equal difficulty: I was going to write a 20 page paper, instead I'm going to organize a symposium at UFM.

A harder or more ambitious project: I was going to paint 5 works, now I'm going to paint 10.

<b>What will be rejected:</b>
Anything that is easier or an attempt to avoid the serious commitment you made in the contract: I was going to write a 20 page paper, now I want to do a 10-point summary.

###Failure of the Learning Contract
Several things can cause failure of the Learning Contract.
1. Failure to complete final evaluations.
2. Failure to turn in grades, contracts, or mentor agreements by their due dates.
3. If a mentor gives a "fail" grade in a pass/fail course.
4. If a mentor gives an F in a letter grade course.
5. If, for some other reason, a mentor refuses to grade the student or terminates the mentorship before the course is over. This does not include uncontrollable circumstances like the mentor becoming ill or having to end the mentorship for reasons that are not the student's responsibility.

<b>What happens if I fail?</b>
Failure of the Learning Contract is failure of the term in the MPC. A failed term means that you forfeit your tuition for that term and will not be awarded UMAs for that contract. Most contract failure will occur at the start or end of the term. However, if you fail in the middle of a term, you may still come to the MPC and participate in activities. However your work will no longer count towards a Learning Contract.

You must pass six terms to graduate from MPC.

Failure is an opportunity to learn. Consider reflecting on your goals and habits if you fail a contract. Although the MPC will strictly enforce these failure conditions, we always offer support for those who wish to learn from failure.

<b>What about my other classes that I didn't fail?</b>
These courses will still appear on your transcript and can still be graded. But they will not be worth any UMAs. We do this so that students still have an incentive to finish the semester if they fail a course halfway through.

<b>What happens to my Fellows Funding?</b>
Failed courses are no longer eligible for Fellows Funding. We will subtract the cost of the course based on the number of courses that you have (ex. 25% of your budget if you fail one out of four courses).

<b>Do I have to repeat courses?</b>
No. Every contract is indepenent. 

####UMAs
UFM organizes courses through credits called "UMAs". An UMA is equivalent to about 15 hours of work. UMAs keep track of your progress toward graduation.

MPC uses a flexible UMA system. Since the MPC does not have traditional classes, the courses you design are assigned UMAs based on their rigorousness. Each term at the MPC is worth 25 UMAs. That's 375 hours of work. Plan accordingly.

That sounds like a lot, but that's about 9 1/2 weeks of work at a full-time job (40 hours a week). You have eighteen weeks to accomplish your goals for the term.

Standard courses worth 4 or 5 UMAs must clearly be rigorous or we won't accept them. Keep this in mind as you plan your contracts.

###Mentors
Mentors are responsible for grading your final evaluation. The MPC can help suggest connections and talk to you about how you can approach a mentor. But you are responsible for finding and confirming your mentor. You may need to be persuasive with some mentors. Your ability to network and secure mentorships is a valuable life skill and part of your education.

Before your Learning Contract is submitted for review, you must confirm the mentors for all of your classes. This means returning (or emailing) a signed and complete mentor agreement form to the MPC for each of your classes.

Use the [MPC Mentor Guide](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2M2x2cTNaSW0zVjA/view?usp=sharing). [update here]

####Flexible Mentoring - Contract for What You Need
The MPC requires that students contract a mentor to provide them with a grade on their final evaluation. Beyond this commitment, there is no minimum (or maximum) mentoring requirement. Schedule check-ins, or not. Get lots of one-on-one time, or not! You can receive feedback from (and negotiate payments with) as many mentors as you want. 

Some students want more attnetion than others. It may be important to meet at certain moments than others. Flexible mentoring lets your contract accommodate your needs and helps you align incentives with your mentor.

####Rate My Mentor
The MPC offers a [simple tool](http://goo.gl/forms/SLbn6SPQlI) for students to rate their mentors at the end of each semester. Check [this database](https://docs.google.com/a/ufm.edu/spreadsheets/d/1Zdr64AMv6m5wfywn4pHhh0bvuCsSryyyC6I0FPSKMKM/edit?usp=sharing) for mentor ideas and to make sure you get a good one! You must be logged in to your UFM account to access these pages.

####Special Offerings
Occasionally the MPC will offer special open courses. Some will be opportunities at UFM or with friends of the MPC. These will have an UMA value and a clear course description announced and published on Slack and elsewhere. The MPC will make these courses and they will be available to you on the platform to enroll. Some special offerings may be competitive or require an application process before a student is accepted.

##Declare your Degree Focus
At the start of your final term, you declare your degree focus. This is like choosing your 'major' in a traditional program, except you design it. A sample focus might be, "Psychology and Education" or "Social Entrepreneurship". Your focus must reflect your studies or it won't be approved. If you studied Medieval Literature, you can't declare a focus in Quantum Physics!

##Experiences
Experiences bring strong community in the MPC. Every term, Fellows are required to provide two experiences to the MPC community. You must provide two experiences, even if you're traveling. Get creative.

Draw on your skills or interest. You can organize a dance class or a workshop on debate. You could lead a field trip or other excursion. You can bring in a visiting speaker. If you're traveling, you can Skype in for your experience. You could also produce a video and organize a screening to share it with the MPC instead.

<b>A word of advice: don't put all your experiences at the end of the term. First, you'll be busy with your final evaluations. Second, space and time fill up and you may not have a room available or MPCers will be too busy to attend. </b>

Experiences don't have to be at the MPC. But they must be open to MPCers and <i>you must be the organizer/creator of the experience</i>.

Promote your experience, especially if it's outside the MPC space. Make a poster and put it on the board. Share it on Slack. You're competing against lots of other cool things. But people will show up if you do a good job and tell people about your experience before it begins! 

<b>You should plan and think about your experiences in advance, but experiences are submitted as you go</b>. Why? Speakers cancel. Changes in logistics happen. Better ideas arise. When you have a good experience ready, submit this simple form to the MPC for approval.

####Milestone Experience
The Milestone is a special type of experience. While MPCers design two experiences for other students, the Milestone is designed for the student herself. Each term MPCers are responsible for one Milestone.

Your Milestone should stretch you beyond your comfort zone. If you're afraid of public speaking, you should give a public lecture. If you've never gone rock climbing, you should go. If you've never been able to continue a habit for more than a week, you could publicly track your habit for three weeks. You could interview someone in a high-pressure situation, or publish something to a wider audience than ever before.

The Milestone is your chance to grow the emotional and psychological skills that you need to be a creator.

###Residency Program
The MPC Residency Program is an opportunity for alumni and others to stay connected to the MPC.

<b>How does it work?</b>
The MPC offers a few slots each semester like “Entrepreneur in Residence”, “Filmmaker in Residence”, “Writer in Residence”, or “Artist in Residence”.

1. Residents apply through a competitive process to the residency. The MPC accepts the best applicant.
2. Residents will be given free access to the MPC and to MPC events/visitors/facilities. They are able to use the MPC space as a co-working environment, including for co-founder or other colleagues. Residents will also be able to use MPC tools like recording or film equipment.
3. Residencies last for a semester.
4. Some residencies will include a modest stipend for the resident’s work in the MPC and funds to cover parking at UFM. 
5. Residents may also be eligible for free or special group rates on trips or other MPC experiences.
6. Residencies may include requests by the MPC for other activities such as working as a mentor or giving workshops. 

##Your First Mentor Meeting
It can be intimidating to ask someone to be your mentor. But you shouldn't be afraid! Most people are flattered and excited when someone is interested in their work. You're so interested, you want to give them the chance to grade your on your work!

However, you should always maintain a professional attitude when you interact with your mentor. Mentors may be busy professionals.

Here's a good way to approach a mentor:
1. Send them an email explaining that you're a student at the MPC, a program that uses paid mentorships to grade students on their work. Thank the mentor for their time.
2. Explain to them that a mentorship is not a significant time commitment. The student is in charge of their learning: mentors aren't expected to hold the student's hand through the course. Mentors are expected to give feedback (either in person or via Skype/email) twice per month and answer the occasional question as the student learns. The mentors will give the student a grade at the end of the term. These are the minimums set by the paid mentorship... a mentor can always agree to chat more or invite the student to events etc!
3. Always be polite with the mentor.
3. Share with them the [mentor agreement](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2M2x2cTNaSW0zVjA/view?usp=sharing), which discusses payment and responsibilities.
4. Thank the mentor for their time, regardless of what they say!

##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

####Residents: We keep residents on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Residents give seminars about areas that they're interested in. They hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

Residents are also there if you need to talk about something. They'll check in occasionally to see how you're doing toward your goals.

[Here's a link to our Resident's Handbook]()

####Tutors
During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professionals from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 12-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

[Here's a link to our Subject Tutor Handbook]()

We bring in a tutor for each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. These experts take you through the main ideas and are available to answer questions during unstructured time at the MPC. It's your responsibility to talk to them if you're confused.

Tutors also provide a portion of the final grade for each Bootcamp subject.

####Mentors 
The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorships. For example, a student may study programming and have a professional programmer evaluate their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them. Mentors give you grades for your final work.

Remember, mentors are often busy people. You don't want to bother them too often. You should view the mentor as a professional contact, not a 'teacher'. You don't ask your mentor "What is the answer to question 3?" You go and do your best to learn as much as you can on your own. The mentor is there for you bring your work for feedback. "How am I doing?" "I'm really stuck on this part." Mentors also can provide the practical, hands-on experience that books and professors cannot. "How do I make a rigorous practice regimen for the guitar?" "What's the best way to approach a client?"

You shouldn't just view mentors as people who give feedback and grades. A good mentorship is often the first step to a job or other professional and life opportunities. Treat your mentors well because they can become lifelong friends and contacts.

[Here's a link to our Mentor Guide](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2M2x2cTNaSW0zVjA/view?usp=sharing)

####Visiting Professors
We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities. Visitors typically dialogue with students about a topic.

[Here's a link to our resources for Visiting Professors]()

####Writing Tutors
Your writing tutor is there to help you whip your writing into shape. They'll lead the Writer's Workshop and they're available to help you when you need it.

> “Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.” ― Isaac Asimov

##Internships
The MPC requires all students to pursue an internship in their second year. Internships may be taken in either term, or both. Internships can also be pursued in the third year, if students want more experience. Internships may be paid or unpaid.

An intensive internship could qualify as a 8 UMA course, like a part-time job. A once-a-week or less demanding internship will be listed on your transcript as a 5 UMA course. 

####Why Internships?
Internships are the best way for you to get professional experience in an area that interests you. The modern internship evolved from the apprenticeships of the past. Apprentices were junior members of a craft. They learned by working closely with a master. Their work was often unglamorous, as internships sometimes are today, but the proximity to the master craftsman more than paid for the work.

An internship is a great way to learn whether you actually like a field or industry. You can see how a real professional works. 
Internships also are ways to build your network. Working first as an intern often lead to jobs or other professional opportunities. You should treat your internship as a serious job and part of your education.

####Finding an Internship
As you work with mentors during Bootcamp and in your Learning Contracts, watch for opportunities to intern. Many people want an intern. It's nice to have someone who wants to help you (usually for free), and who is interested in your work. Many people don't know they want an intern until you suggest it... so ask!

The MPC has a rich network of possible internships. Talk to residents, classmates, mentors, and anyone else around the MPC. Someone will know somebody who can help. On-sight internships are preferred but, if necessary, an internship could even be conducted digitally, with tools like Skype and Googledocs.

If existing internships look boring, pitch your own. Many times a business or other organization can be convinced to offer a new internship based around what you want to learn, as long as it makes value for their organization.

If you need help with how to approach an internship opportunity, talk to someone with more experience. The MPC can help you make a connection, but <b>you are responsible for approaching the mentor and convincing them to employ you as an intern.</b> This is a valuable and important life skill and it's part of your education. Make sure you check out visa requirements if you're traveling abroad!

###Confirming your Internship with the MPC
The MPC needs your internship to send an acceptance letter to mpc@ufm.edu. This is so we know you have secured your internship. To incorporate your internship into your learning contract, you'll also need to submit a mentor agreement form (usually it's your boss who signs it!).

##Graduation and Life Beyond the MPC
We want the MPC to prepare you for life beyond school. As a community for creative leaders, graduation requirements reflect our commitment to your long term work as a creator.

A few years out of college, when most students are in their mid-20s, people already look more at what you've accomplished than at where you went to school. This doesn't mean that your credential doesn't matter. We want the MPC to provide both: a strong credential and a record of great work.

####Portfolio
In the long run, a portfolio of great creative work is more important than your degree. Your degree and the connections you get from the MPC will open doors and prepare you for graduate school or professional life. But eventually people want to see a strong record of work, not a credential. We want you to graduate with both.

All new students admitted to the MPC are asked to make a portfolio. We base a portion of the admissions decision on it. This portfolio will be the basis of the work you'll build over the program.

Not everything goes in a portfolio. Put stuff that you're proud of and that's relevant to your future customers/bosses/clients. Think of yourself as a brand – how do you want people to perceive you when they browse your portfolio? Portfolios may be on paper or online. Ideally, you should have a version of both.

Portfolios help you get into graduate school and they can land you a good job. If you plan to start your own business or work as a freelancer, your portfolio is like an elaborate business card. Building a portfolio can be fun and it's worth it. Coaches are available if you need help. And don't forget that your peers are there for feedback too.

####Great Work
When you begin your Great Work in the 3rd year, we expect you to take a lighter load of extra classes. <b>Your Great Work should be clearly incorporated into your contract as a course.</b> Your Great Work course should be the heaviest of all your courses (6-8 UMAs). Developing your Great Work could be a 8 UMA course, which would leave 12 UMAs left to design additional courses (two five UMA courses and a 2 UMA course). You're still responsible for your Milestone Challenge and experiences in the MPC.

A sample contract may look like this:

1. Course Built Around Development Steps of Great Work (8 UMAs)
2. Supplemental Courses (12 UMAs)
3. Experiential Learning: Milestone and Experiences (5 UMAs)

You might use your Milestone and experiences as a way to further or enhance your great work. Run a focus group for your new business. Do a public reading of your novel in the MPC. Test your app with fellow students. Run a dialogue on the tough creative problem you're facing.

Your Great Work is meant to take you to success beyond the MPC. Students in traditional college programs face a common problem: they graduate with a degree and suddenly find themselves out in the real world with no idea what to do. The Great Work is how the MPC helps students avoid this fate.

Your Great Work should demonstrate your own development as a creator. It's the culmination of your work in the MPC.

Your Great Work should be clearly ambitious and show leadership. Getting a job may be part of your Great Work, but it can't be the whole thing. You need to prove that you are capable of going your own way, even if that means developing something within an existing business or organization. You can do your Great Work with others in the MPC, such as founding a business together – but everyone has to be involved. No freeriders.

Take advantage of the Learning Contract as a tool to structure your Great Work. The landmarks you set in your class can keep you on track as you develop your project (for example, "Publish Chapter 1", "Sell one unit of my product" etc).

#####Great Work Panel
The Great Work panel is how the MPC evaluates your Great Work and the focus you define for your degree. The Great Work Panel is an hour-long discussion with a jury of mentors, peers, or experts in the area of your interest. The Great Work Panel is a more intense version of the interview panel that evaluates students for admission.

The panel evaluates the student's knowledge of their degree focus as well as their progress of their Great Work. Ambitious Great Works are unlikely to be finished by the end of the third year. The panel does not expect the student to have completed everything, but to demonstrate their hard work, their progress, and share the lessons they have learned. Students are also expected to demonstrate significant knowledge in the field of their focus. For example, a student who has studied education and psychology should be able to discuss major ideas in both fields with sophistication and ease.

<b>Panel Makeup</b>
The panel is defined as follows:
1. A panelist chosen by the MPC
2. A panelist chosen by the student (they can not be a family member or close friend)
3. A panelist mutually agreed upon by both student and MPC

<b>Panel Verdict</b>
The verdict of the panel must be <b>unanimous</b> for the student to pass.

<b>Failure of the Great Work Panel</b>
If a student fails the Great Work Panel, the panel will talk with the student about what must be improved. The panel and student will devise a future date to attempt the panel again when the student has made more progress. Students cannot graduate until they pass their Great Work Panel.

####Centro Henry Hazlitt Requirements for MPC
UFM requires all students to pass basic economic proficiency exams to graduate. This is taught and tested through Centro Henry Hazlitt (CHH).

MPC students must pass an exam that tests Basic Economics (called Proceso 1 and 2 at UFM) and Ética (basically the philosophy of individual liberty class).

The MPC has a list of all the concepts and ideas from these courses. We give you the list and we curate some materials to give you direction, if you need it. You can learn these ideas in any way you want. You can find a tutor, you can work together, you can ask us to help, you can go online etc. When you're ready, you take the test. If you pass, you'll have fulfilled the graduation requirement.

Don't be worried about this requirement. The ideas are not difficult and everyone who has graduated from UFM has passed these tests. Though the ideas aren't difficult, they are tremendously valuable for helping you understand the world. You can get this requirement out of the way as soon as you wish.

####Degree and Focus
The MPC awards B.A. degrees in Liberal Studies with a focus that you define. A sample degree would read, "Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. Concentration: Social Entrepreneurship".

##Graduation Checklist
1. Six terms passed in the MPC (250 UMAs)
2. One successful internship (with a 'passed' letter of recommendation)
3. Great Work Panel passedme

###Policy for Changes to the MPC
Occasionally, the MPC program changes. New opportunities emerge, or we discover that something doesn't work well. We are always interested in improving the program, so bring us your ideas!

However if we change the program based on the demands of small groups or single students, we create unhealthy power dynamics. Students then form small coalitions and try to lobby the administration to change policies. This is a bad way to run a program.

So the rule is simple:

If you think something needs to be changed, first talk with your classmates. Convince them why things would be better with a change. Once you have consensus, bring the idea to the MPC administration.

Why do we do this?
1. To avoid the unhealthy power dynamics
2. To make sure no one has major changes randomly imposed on them, without any idea of what's coming
3. To encourage group coherence and cooperation
4. Because if everybody agrees with a change, it's probably an important one to make.

###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creative leader is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions specifically about creative development. These discussions have a philosophical and a practical side. Sometimes we'll focus on themes like integrity, authenticity, grit, or creative courage. Other times we'll learn about project management, how to deal with difficult people, or organizational skills.

Starting at Orientation Day, students are asked to examine questions of their own personal philosophy. Students read, participate in discussions, attend workshops, and have experiences meant to encourage them to become more authentic, to give and receive honest feedback, and to become courageous and creative non-conformists.

Students are asked to look deep within themselves to find their a creative calling. As students learn more about the world and understand themselves better, they prepare to enter their second year of apprenticeship and to explore their creative medium in the third year.

###MPC Pre-Semester
The Pre-MPC Term is a chance for students to practice the self-directed study format of Year 2 and 3 through a funded MPC Learning Contract.  Students will become familiar with the MPC methodology, explore their interests and build skills of self-discipline which will provide them an advantage before entering the MPC three-year program. This will also provide the student the opportunity to enhance their MPC curriculum with an extra semester of courses.

Cost: 
Cost Per Term: $4,000
UFM Service Monthly Fee: $40
* detailed information in in the “MPC Payment Fees” document

Credits: UMAs will be awarded and will appear on your transcripts along with each course. This UMAs will constitute extra credits to enhance your pensum, they are not considered substitute credits for the official program. You are still required to follow up with the complete three year Program and accomplish the full 150 UMAs.

<b>Pre-Semester Courses</b>
The Pre-Semester comes with a standard set of courses. Some are fixed and others can be designed by the student. Each is worth 5 UMAs and is evaluated by letter-grade (nota literal).

Learning How to Learn (Aprendiendo a Aprender)
In this course, students are challenged to reexamine the ways in which they learn. Students will practice the skills of a self-directed learner, learn to become conscious of their own habits and learning process, and experiment with different learning techniques.

Self-Directed Study (Estudio Autodirigido)
In this course, the student has the chance to design a course of study using the MPC methodology and tools. Courses may be on any subject of the student’s interest and can employ online, experiential, and collaborative learning or other tools.

Independent Project (Proyecto Independiente)
Students design and execute an independent project of their own. Projects are expected to be concrete and take forms like a prototype, a product, or a published work.

Professional Development (Desarrollo Profesional)
In this course, students have the opportunity to begin to bridge their professional and academic lives through an internship or work-study opportunity. Internships are led by the student and they are expected to receive a successful letter of recommendation at the end of the experience. 

Experiential Learning (Aprendizaje Experiencial)
Students demonstrate leadership and explore their subject of interest by designing, planning, and executing experiences for co-learners. Students also design, plan, and complete a Milestone Challenge: an endeavor that induces them to reach outside their comfort zone like presenting a lecture, traveling by themselves, or overcoming a major fear.

Students receive a Fellow's Fund of Q5000 for their pre-semester contract. The MPC is happy to help with tutors, orienting a new student to the contract process, and with other needs.

<b>Tips for a Good Pre-Semester</b>
Knock out CHH: The Pre-Semester is a good opportunity to knock out CHH requirements before you begin Bootcamp.
Take a Risk: The Pre-Semester is a great chance to take big risks in how you learn, so that you are prepared for the higher-stakes contracts in the second and third year.
Participate: You're free to join Bootcamp activities, open courses by Fellows, and experiences by MPCers.
