##History of the MPC
Noncoercive education essay. Giancarlo. Late-2012. Brand new model in late 2014.

##The MPCer
As an MPCer, you were chosen as members of a rare breed. MPCers show a rare combination of maturity, focus, and creative talent.

####Creative Professionalism
MPCers train to be pros. 

####Lifelong Learner
Insatiable curiosity

##What do you need for the MPC?

<b>A well-functioning modern laptop</b>
Your laptop is an indispensible part of your education. Consider it an investment in your future. Most people use Macbooks in  the MPC, but PCs are fine too. We don't recommend 'netbooks' or Macbook Airs. They are usually not powerful enough, don't include CD/DVD drive, and have occasional hardware problems.

What about books?
Most readings will be distributed digitally. We'll rarely ask for you to buy physical copies of books, although you are free to do so if you prefer to read that way.

Software?
We recommend Microsoft Office and design programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. These are not absolutely necessary since Google Docs exists. But they may come in handy.

Creative materials?
If you want to spend your time working on a craft that requires lots of materials such as painting, you are responsible for those materials. The MPC does have some materials available. These are shared and you can't always count on their availability. Bring what you need. <b>If you don't want people to use your stuff, make sure you CLEARLY label what's yours.</b> Better yet, bring a box or other container where you can store creative materials. For the most part, we're a trustworthy bunch!

##Bootcamp
Year one is Learning Bootcamp. The theme of the first year is "Explore Your Calling".

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing

As you master these skills, you'll learn the core ideas of ten subjects.

1. Philosophy
2. Biology and Evolution
3. Psychology
4. Economics, Finance and Money
5. Political Science, Law and Sociology
6. Physics, Statistics and Probability
7. History and Literature
8. Art, Design, and Cultural Evolution
9. Technology
10. Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Why did we choose these subjects? 
Because they're the most important fields for the development of creative individuals. After Bootcamp, you should understand the main ideas of each field. You won't yet be an expert. But you'll be ready to decide which areas you want to study more deeply.

How will you learn the subjects? 
Dialogues with experts, experiential learning, and independent reading and writing.

Here are the main components of the Bootcamp:
1. Core Dialogues
2. Experiential Learning Days
3. Creative Development Seminars
4. Writer's Clinic
5. Bootcamp Learning Contracts
6. ExpoDay

The first step to success is showing up. <b>All components are mandatory for Bootcampers</b>

###Core Dialogues
Students have focused dialogues about the main ideas of the subject. <b>You must do your reading before these dialogues begin or you will be lost.</b> Core dialogues meet on Days 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11 of each subject cycle. Occasionally there will be other days devoted to core ideas. These conversations are intense and cover a lot of material, so get a good night's sleep the day before.

####Independent reading?
On Day One of each Bootcamp, you'll choose independent reading in the subject. This reading, selected from a curated list, will inform your talk on ExpoDay and your work in the Writer's Clinic. Choose something that interests you, because you're going to write and speak about the book. If you really don't like any of the books on the list, you can suggest a book of comparable quality in the subject. But it will have to be approved by the MPC. Talk to the subject expert if you're confused about your book.


Students learn writing in a clinical environment throughout the Bootcamp. The first half of the year, students produce book reviews based on their reading. During the second half, students are expected to become more critical and write lengthier, more personal essay on their reading.




####Bootcamp Grades




###Writer's Clinic
The Writer's Clinic is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. In the first half of Bootcamp, you write book reviews. In the second half, you write essays.

#####Book Reviews
Students are responsible for producing a high-quality 1000-2000 word review of their book each subject cycle. 

During week one, students pre-read and write their introduction. The MPC Writer’s Clinic meets and we review. 

During week two, students should reach the end of their book. Students produce an outline and write sections to summarize each chapter. 

During week three, students produce a first draft of the entire piece. The writer’s clinic meets for peer review in groups of 2-3 students. 

During week four, students schedule a one-on-one consultation with a writing tutor. During the final days students prepare to publish their review, share it with their subject mentor, and to participate in ExpoDay.

[Here's the rubric for book reviews](PUTLINKHERE)

#####Essay
Essays follow a similar format to book reviews. But essays offer greater freedom than the review. There is no page limit to the essay. It is expected to be as concise as possible while still conveying the most important information on their topic. Think of it as a chapter in a textbook. Make it clear and entertaining. On the first day of Prep Week, students exchange their essays with each other. On the fourth day, students receive their drafts with feedback from their reviewer(s).



####Checkpoints
Each week there's an important event in the Writer's Clinic.

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction
Read preface, introduction, and at least the first chapter of the book. 
Read liner notes and any commentary on the back cover. 
Scan or speed-read the final chapter or conclusion. 

You need to bring this to the workshop:
1. Your introduction (a strong first paragraph)

During pre-reading, you want to look for material to include in your intro. Around the middle of the first week, write your introduction—i.e., your first paragraph—focusing on the overarching importance or uniqueness of the book, any controversy it might stir, the author’s reputation, etc. Bring a draft of your opening paragraph to the first one-hour session that we have scheduled in order to discuss this step.

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters
Finish your book this week. Coordinate your notes and start to synthesize them into paragraph-length summaries of each chapter. Don't just regurgitate. Have some style. Remember that one short, powerful quote is worth more than ten huge block quotes. 

Bring this to the workshop:
1. An outline of your review
2. A first draft of the paragraphs devoted to chapter summaries
3. A first draft of the final paragraph where you offer your own opinion of the book

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review
Time for some serious editing. We'll break up into groups of 2-3 for peer review. Read your work out loud to the reviewers, who take notes and give feedback. Listen to how your writing sounds as you speak it. If it sounds confusing or dumb when it's said – it's bad writing.

Bring this to the workshop:
1. Your complete first draft

[Here's a checklist for peer-review](LINK HERE)

<b>You must schedule a consultation with an MPC writing tutor for the next week</b>

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

[Here's a checklist of all the steps presented here, week-by-week.](linkhere)

###ExpoDay
On ExpoDay, we open the program to the public. Students give their presentations in a rapid-fire TED-style event. Students are expected to demonstrate their mastery of their chosen area. Essays or book reviews are also due on ExpoDay. These essays are bound into a Bootcamp Book and given to the students at the end of the first year. Your essay or review becomes a chapter in this student-produced textbook of all ten subjects.

###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creator is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions specifically about creative development. These discussions have a philosophical and a practical side. Sometimes we'll focus on themes like integrity, honesty and authenticity, or creative courage. Other times we'll learn about project management, how to deal with difficult people, or organizational skills.

Starting in the Bootcamp, students are asked to examine questions of their own personal philosophy. Students read, participate in discussions, attend workshops, and have experiences meant to encourage them to become more authentic, to give and receive honest feedback, and to become courageous and creative non-conformists.

Students are asked to look deep within themselves to find their Inner Calling. As students learn more about the world and understand themselves better, they prepare to enter their second year of apprenticeship and to explore their creative medium.



###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and writing. In between core dialogues, the subject expert will assign you other activities to learn the ideas. For example, in psychology you may have to go out and sell products using persuasion techniques. Or perhaps we'll visit real biologist's lab during biology.

Experiential learning will take you outside the MPC.

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
We encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will not be held accountable for their learning contracts. Instead, they are encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students, seminars led by coaches, and to focus on their Bootcamp work.

###ExpoDay
ExpoDay is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. The MPC opens up to the public. Bootcampers give their ExpoDay talks: 5-7 minute TEDtalk-style presentations about their independent reading. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Students in their second and third years can also show their work on ExpoDay. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.


##Learning Contracts
Years two and three are governed entirely by Learning Contract. 

Check out our Learning Contract step-by-step for more details.





##Values and Philosophy
At the MPC we value hard work, authenticity, professionalism, and creative individuality.

Hard work means that students are expected to stay in the driver's seat of their education. 

Professionalism means that expect each other to avoid excuses. Any work worth doing is worth doing well. From mentorships to internships to leading an experience in the MPC, we expect everyone to do the best work possible.

Authenticity means that the MPC is a safe place to be yourself. We may disagree, but we don't take it personally. You're free to 
Creative individuality means that everything we do is meant to make you a more confident, skilled, and disciplined creator. Creativity is the ultimate resource. But, sadly, it's rarely cultivated in traditional schools.


##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

Personal Coaches: We keep coaches on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Coaches give regular seminars about areas that they're experts in. Coaches hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

Subject Experts: During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professional scholars from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 16-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

 We bring in an expert for each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. These experts take you through the main ideas and are available to answer questions during unstructured time at the MPC. It's your responsibility to talk to them if you're confused.

Mentors: The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorship to create grades and connect you with internships and other experiences. For example, a student this semester is studying programming and we have a professional programmer who is evaluating their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them.

Visiting Professors: We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities.

##Advice
The MPC is not easy. With freedom comes responsibility. You should take your goal-setting seriously. Set goals that challenge you, but that you can achieve each term. Coaches are here to help. All courses must be rigorous, or we won't approve them.
