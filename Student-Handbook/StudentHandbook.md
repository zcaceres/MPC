##The MPCer
As an MPCer, you were chosen as members of a rare breed. MPCers show a rare combination of maturity, focus, and creative talent.

##Bootcamp
Year one is the bootcamp

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing.

###Core Dialogues


###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creator is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions about creative development. 

###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and 

###Writer's Clinic
The Writer's Clinic is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. Re

There's an important checkpoint each week.

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
We encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will not be held accountable for their learning contracts. Instead, they are encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students, seminars led by coaches, and to focus on their Bootcamp work.

###ExpoDay
ExpoDay is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. The MPC opens up to the public. Bootcampers give their ExpoDay talks: 5-7 minute TEDtalk-style presentations about their independent reading. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Students in their second and third years can also show their work on ExpoDay. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.


##Learning Contracts
Years two and three are governed entirely by Learning Contract. 

Check out our Learning Contract step-by-step for more details.


##Values and Philosophy
At the MPC we value hard work, authenticity, professionalism, and creative individuality.

Hard work means that students are expected to stay in the driver's seat of their education. 

Professionalism means that expect each other to avoid excuses. Any work worth doing is worth doing well. From mentorships to internships to leading an experience in the MPC, we expect everyone to do the best work possible.

Authenticity means that the MPC is a safe place to be yourself. We may disagree, but we don't take it personally. You're free to 
Creative individuality means that everything we do is meant to make you a more confident, skilled, and disciplined creator. Creativity is the ultimate resource. But, sadly, it's rarely cultivated in traditional schools.


##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

Personal Coaches: We keep coaches on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Coaches give regular seminars about areas that they're experts in. Coaches hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

Subject Experts: During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professional scholars from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 16-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

Mentors: The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorship to create grades and connect you with internships and other experiences. For example, a student this semester is studying programming and we have a professional programmer who is evaluating their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them.

Visiting Professors: We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities.

##Advice
The MPC is not easy. With freedom comes responsibility. You should take your goal-setting seriously. Set goals that challenge you, but that you can achieve each term. Coaches are here to help. All courses must be rigorous, or we won't approve them.
