##History of the MPC
Noncoercive education essay. Giancarlo. Late-2012. Brand new model in late 2014.

##What do you need for the MPC?

<b>A well-functioning modern laptop</b>
Your laptop is an indispensible part of your education. Consider it an investment in your future. Most people use Macbooks in  the MPC, but PCs are fine too. We don't recommend 'netbooks' or Macbook Airs. They are usually not powerful enough, don't include CD/DVD drive, and have occasional hardware problems.

What about books?
Most readings will be distributed digitally. We'll rarely ask for you to buy physical copies of books, although you are free to do so if you prefer to read that way.

Software?
We recommend Microsoft Office and design programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. These are not absolutely necessary since Google Docs exists. But they may come in handy.

Creative materials?
If you want to spend your time working on a craft that requires lots of materials such as painting, you are responsible for those materials. The MPC does have some materials available. These are shared and you can't always count on their availability. Bring what you need. <b>If you don't want people to use your stuff, make sure you CLEARLY label what's yours.</b> Better yet, bring a box or other container where you can store creative materials. For the most part, we're a trustworthy bunch!

##MPChat with Slack
When you enroll in the MPC, we'll invite you to our private online chatroom. We use a platform called Slack.

Slack is divided into independent chat rooms called channels. Most of the channels should be pretty obvious. Put cool stuff for others in "#share", put experiences in "#experiences", and put lolcats in "#random". Please be respectful of others on Slack.

<b>It is your responsibility to check Slack regularly so that you don't miss important announcements.</b>

##Hours and the MPC Space
The MPC space at UFM is open from XX:XX to 9:00pm, Monday through Friday. 

As a student of the MPC, you have exclusive access to this space. You are always welcome. Please be respectful of others and the resources of the MPC.

Bootcamp courses are scheduled for each subject cycle. We don't schedule things into the evening because we believe you need time with friends, family, loved ones, and to do other activities. 

Aside from Bootcamp, the MPC does not have an official daily schedule. The schedule emerges from the courses and experiences designed by MPCers. Consult the MPC calendar to find regular seminars, experiences, student-led courses, dialogues with visitors, and other events. 

<b>It's important to check your calendar regularly.</b>

##Bootcamp
Year one is Learning Bootcamp. The theme of the first year is "Explore Your Calling".

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing

As you master these skills, you'll learn the core ideas of ten subjects.

1. Philosophy
2. Biology and Evolution
3. Psychology
4. Economics, Finance and Money
5. Political Science, Law and Sociology
6. Physics, Statistics and Probability
7. History and Literature
8. Art, Design, and Cultural Evolution
9. Technology
10. Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Why did we choose these subjects? 
Because they're the most important fields for the development of creative individuals. After Bootcamp, you should understand the main ideas of each field. You won't yet be an expert. But you'll be ready to decide which areas you want to study more deeply.

What are the "course texts"?
Each subject has texts defined by the subject tutor. Don't worry, the MPC will provide you with digital copies.

Here's important texts for understanding the MPC in general.

2. [You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html)

How will you learn the subjects? 
Dialogues with experts, experiential learning, and independent reading and writing.

Here are the main components of the Bootcamp:
1. Core Dialogues
2. Experiential Learning Days
3. Creative Development Seminars
4. Writer's Studio
5. Bootcamp Learning Contracts
6. ExpoDay

The first step to success is showing up. <b>All components are mandatory for Bootcampers</b>

###Core Dialogues
Students have focused dialogues about the main ideas of the subject. <b>You must do your reading before these dialogues begin or you will be lost.</b> Core dialogues meet on Days 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11 of each subject cycle. Occasionally there will be other days devoted to core ideas. These conversations are intense and cover a lot of material, so get a good night's sleep the day before.

####Independent reading?
On Day One of each Bootcamp, you'll choose independent reading in the subject. This reading, selected from a curated list, will inform your talk on ExpoDay and your work in the Writer's Studio. Choose something that interests you, because you're going to write and speak about the book. If you really don't like any of the books on the list, you can suggest a book of comparable quality in the subject. But it will have to be approved by the MPC. Talk to the subject expert if you're confused about your book.


Students learn writing in a workshop environment throughout the Bootcamp. The first half of the year, students produce book reviews based on their reading. During the second half, students are expected to become more critical and write lengthier, more personal essay on their reading.




####Bootcamp Grades




###Writer's Studio
Good writing is clear thinking made visible. Written communication is especially key to the digital age.

Whatever path you take, you need to write well. The MPC Writer's Studio is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. In the first half of Bootcamp, you write book reviews. In the second half, you write essays. Book reviews are less critical and more structured. Essays are freer and include more of your voice. You graduate to the freedom of the essay through rigorous practice of the review.

#####Book Reviews
Students are responsible for producing a high-quality 1000-2000 word review of their book each subject cycle. 

[Here's the rubric for book reviews and some samples of good work.](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2dG1jUF9PR2xkN3M/view?usp=sharing)

#####Essay
Essays follow a similar format to book reviews. But essays offer greater freedom than the review. There is no page limit to the essay. It is expected to be as concise as possible while still conveying the most important information on their topic. You can include references to other readings and your own opinions. Think of it as an engaging chapter in a book. Make it clear. Make it entertaining. Make it professional.

####Writing Checkpoints
Each week there's an important event in the Writer's Studio.

During week one, students pre-read and write their introduction. The MPC Writer’s Studio meets and we review. 
During week two, students should reach the end of their book. Students produce an outline and write sections to summarize each chapter. 
During week three, students produce a first draft of the entire piece. The Writer’s Studio meets for peer review in groups of 2-3 students. 
During week four, students schedule a one-on-one consultation with a writing tutor. During the final days students prepare to publish their review, share it with their subject mentor, and to participate in ExpoDay.

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction
Read preface, introduction, and at least the first chapter of the book. 
Read liner notes and any commentary on the back cover. 
Scan or speed-read the final chapter or conclusion. 

Look for material to include in your intro. Around the middle of the first week, write your introduction—i.e., your first paragraph — focusing on the overarching importance or uniqueness of the book, any controversy it might stir, the author’s reputation, etc.

You need to bring this to the workshop:
1. Your introduction (a strong first paragraph)

Now get reading! You probably should schedule clear reading goals so you finish on-time. Talk to a coach or co-learner if you need help with this.

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters
Finish your book this week. Coordinate your notes and start to synthesize them into paragraph-length summaries of each chapter. Don't just regurgitate. Have some style. Remember that one short, powerful quote is worth more than ten huge block quotes. 

Bring this to the workshop:
1. An outline of your review
2. A first draft of the paragraphs devoted to chapter summaries
3. A first draft of the final paragraph where you offer your own opinion of the book

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review
Time for some serious editing. We'll break up into groups of 2-3 for peer review. Read your work out loud to the reviewers, who take notes and give feedback. Listen to how your writing sounds as you speak it. If it sounds confusing or dumb when it's said – it's bad writing.

Bring this to the peer review workshop:
1. Your complete first draft

[Here's a checklist for peer review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InB9QeJ0qQxazB9ND8TT6mXFqtKxAoMmcnUwBKAMCRo/edit?usp=sharing)

<b>You must schedule a consultation with an MPC writing tutor for the next week</b> You should have revised your draft based on the peer review. Bring a polished second draft to your consultation.

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

Bring this to your consult with a Writing Tutor:
1. Your second draft (which must include feedback from peer review)

[Here's a checklist for final draft review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1do1op-_3iTYL1FXMEXacLEHzs77webrJmNp7RRZn5Tw/edit?usp=sharing)

We'll do this same process for every subject. 
In case you need a reminder, [here's a checklist of all the steps presented here, week-by-week.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hR9BH3zlUSN8mUYpFovp9n8UW7i5afjCumm3paaYN0/edit?usp=sharing)

###ExpoDay
ExpoDay is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. Bootcampers give their ExpoDay presentations about their independent reading. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Essays or book reviews are due on ExpoDay. These essays are bound into a Bootcamp Book and given to the students at the end of the first year. Your essay or review becomes a chapter in this student-produced textbook of all ten subjects.

On ExpoDay, we open the program to the public. Your parents might show up. Students are expected to demonstrate their mastery of their chosen area in a creative format. 

ExpoDay is mostly for Bootcampers. Students in their second and third years can also show their work on ExpoDay. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.

####Public Speaking at ExpoDay
Public speaking is a core skill of the MPC. ExpoDay is practice. Writing and public speaking serve different purposes. [Read this essay to understand why](http://paulgraham.com/speak.html). Put simply, writing generates, clarifies, and organizes ideas. Speaking convinces, entertains, and inspires action. A creator needs both.

Your book review or essay should be a clean and accurate exposition of the book. But your ExpoDay presentation is your chance to engage more creatively with the ideas. These are not book reports or 'class presentations' like middle school. Get critical with the ideas. Put your own spin on them. Express an argument, point out something insightful or strange.

By default, everyone gives a 5-7 minute TED-talk style lecture on the subject. But ExpoDay has an open format. You can suggest something else instead.

Example ExpoDay presentations might include:
1. A theaterical monologue or dialogue
2. A song about the ideas
3. Sculpture or art on the subject theme
4. A timed debate with a classmate
5. A live experiment

The format is up to you. But it needs to include a public-speaking component. Before you perform your song, give some remarks about why you wrote it. Explain your art. Frame the scene.

You can do it alone, or you can work with others. Everyone needs a main role, though. No freeloaders.

<b>Whatever format you choose, your presentation is expected to be strong and professional. Remember, you'll have a real audience.</b>

You'll be graded by the audience and the MPC for your work on ExpoDay. Take it seriously.

###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creator is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions specifically about creative development. These discussions have a philosophical and a practical side. Sometimes we'll focus on themes like integrity, authenticity, grit, or creative courage. Other times we'll learn about project management, how to deal with difficult people, or organizational skills.

Starting at Orientation Day, students are asked to examine questions of their own personal philosophy. Students read, participate in discussions, attend workshops, and have experiences meant to encourage them to become more authentic, to give and receive honest feedback, and to become courageous and creative non-conformists.

Students are asked to look deep within themselves to find their a creative calling. As students learn more about the world and understand themselves better, they prepare to enter their second year of apprenticeship and to explore their creative medium in the third year.

> “Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person.” ― Immanuel Kant

###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and writing. In between core dialogues, the subject expert will assign you other activities to learn the ideas. For example, in psychology you may have to go out and sell products using persuasion techniques. Or perhaps we'll visit real biologist's lab during biology. We'll watch films and complete workshops.

Experiential learning will sometimes take you outside the MPC. Come prepared with whatever you need that day (jacket, wallet, phone, etc.)

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
During Bootcamp, we encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. This software is the backbone of the second and third year. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will be held accountable for their learning contracts, but the courses they design will not appear on their transcript.

In later years, you'll design courses that last a semester. During bootcamp, students design a new mini-course every six weeks. Bootcampers are also encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students and seminars led by coaches. Otherwise, focus on your Bootcamp work.

<b>The role of Learning Contracts during Bootcamp is to discover what kind of learner you are.</b> Do you work well with online courses? Or should you go find a job or internship to practice your skills? Do you learn best through listening, or perhaps reading? Bootcamp is your chance to discover your learning style at almost no-risk. Work hard on this because, once the second year starts, there's no going back on your contracts.

##Learning Contracts
Years two and three are governed entirely by Learning Contract. 

Check out our Learning Contract step-by-step for more details.

Watch this intro video for how to use our software.

####UMAs
UFM organizes courses through credits called "UMAs". An UMA is equivalent to about 15 hours of work. UMAs keep track of your progress toward graduation.

MPC uses a flexible UMA system. Since the MPC does not have traditional classes, the courses you design are assigned UMAs based on their rigorousness. Each term at the MPC is worth 25 UMAs. That's 375 hours of work. Plan accordingly.

That sounds like a lot, but that's about 9 1/2 weeks of work at a full-time job (40 hours a week). You have eighteen weeks to accomplish your goals for the term.

Standard courses worth 4 or 5 UMAs must clearly be rigorous or we won't accept them. Keep this in mind as you plan your contracts.

####Mentors



##Experiences

<b>A word of advice: don't put all your experiences at the end of the term. First, you'll be busy with your final evaluations. Second, space and time fill up and you may not have a room available or MPCers will be too busy to attend. </b>

####Milestone Experience
Each semester MPCers are responsible for a single but more serious personal experience. While MPCers design two experiences for other students, the Milestone is designed for the student herself.

Your Milestone should stretch you beyond your comfort zone.

> “All the world is my school and all humanity is my teacher.” ― George Whitman

##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

Personal Coaches: We keep coaches on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Coaches give regular seminars about areas that they're experts in. Coaches hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

[Here's a link to our Coach's Handbook]()

Subject Experts: During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professionals from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 12-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

[Here's a link to our Subject Expert Handbook]()

We bring in an expert for each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. These experts take you through the main ideas and are available to answer questions during unstructured time at the MPC. It's your responsibility to talk to them if you're confused.

Experts also provide a portion of the final grade for each Bootcamp subject.

Mentors: The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorships. For example, a student may study programming and have a professional programmer evaluate their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them. Mentors give you grades for your final work.

Remember, mentors are often busy people. You don't want to bother them too often. You should view the mentor as a professional contact, not a 'teacher'. You don't ask your mentor "What is the answer to question 3?" You go and do your best to learn as much as you can on your own. The mentor is there for you bring your work for feedback. "How am I doing?" "I'm really stuck on this part." Mentors also can provide the practical, hands-on experience that books and professors cannot. "How do I make a rigorous practice regimen for the guitar?" "What's the best way to to approach a client?"

You shouldn't just view mentors as people who give feedback and grades. A good mentorship is often the first step to a job or other professional and life opportunities. Treat your mentors well because they can become lifelong friends and contacts.

[Here's a link to our Mentor Handbook]()

Visiting Professors: We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities. Visitors typically dialogue with students about a topic.

##Portfolio
In the long run, a portfolio of great creative work is more important than your degree. Your degree and the connections you get from the MPC will open doors and prepare you for graduate school or professional life. But eventually people want to see a strong record of work, not a credential. We want you to graduate with both.

All new students admitted to the MPC are asked to make a portfolio. We base a portion of the admissions decision on it. This portfolio will be the basis of the work they'll build over the program.

Not everything goes in a portfolio. Put stuff that you're proud of and that's relevant to your future customers/bosses/clients. Think of yourself as a brand – how do you want people to perceive you when they browse your portfolio? Portfolios may be on paper or online. Ideally, you should have a version of both.

Portfolios help you get into graduate school and they can land you a good job. If you plan to start your own business or work as a freelancer, your portfolio is like an elaborate business card. Buildinga portfolio can be fun and it's worth it. Let us know if you need help. 

##Great Work
