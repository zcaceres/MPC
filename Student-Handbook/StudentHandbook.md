##Mindset
The MPC is built on the <i>growth mindset</i>. Put simply, it means that our program focuses on habits of learning rather than a curriculum built on textbooks or lectures. Important habits include: risk taking, a willingness to fail, perserverence, lifelong learning, and self-direction.

Someone with a 'growth mindset' believes that talents and skills can be cultivated and learned. Indeed, they must be – if the learner wants to become great. So the person with a growth mindset focuses on hard work, good habits, and rising to meet new challenges.

The opposite of a growth mindset is a 'fixed mindset'. People with this mindset believe that their intelligence, skills, or personality traits are set for life. People with fixed mindsets avoid challenge and risk, because it threatens their ego and identity as a "smart" or "skilled" person. 

Those with a growth mindset treat life as a constant adventure and every new challenge as a chance to learn and grow. The MPC gives students a chance to change their mindset and become lifelong learners.

Read more about Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck's pioneering work in her book <i>Mindset</i>. [Here's a summary](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).

##What do you need for the MPC?

<b>A well-functioning modern laptop</b>
Your laptop is an indispensible part of your education. Consider it an investment in your future. Most people use Macbooks in  the MPC, but PCs are fine too. However, if you use a PC, it's your responsibility to deal with problems like computer viruses. We don't recommend 'netbooks' or Macbook Airs. They are usually not powerful enough, don't include CD/DVD drive, and have occasional hardware problems.

What about books?
Most readings will be distributed digitally. We'll rarely ask for you to buy physical copies of books, although you are free to do so if you prefer to read that way. A lot of MPCers are bibliophiles and know tons of books. Ask them if you need something to read, or check out our lending library.

Software?
We recommend Microsoft Office and design programs like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. These are not absolutely necessary since Google Docs exists. But they may come in handy.

Creative materials?
If you want to spend your time working on a craft that requires lots of materials such as painting, you are responsible for those materials. The MPC does have some materials available. These are shared and you can't always count on their availability. Bring what you need. <b>If you don't want people to use your stuff, make sure you CLEARLY label what's yours.</b> Better yet, bring a box or other container where you can store creative materials. We're a trustworthy bunch, but it's better to avoid any problems.

##MPChat with Slack
When you enroll in the MPC, we'll invite you to our private online chatroom. We use a platform called Slack.

Slack is divided into independent chat rooms called channels. Most of the channels should be pretty obvious. Put cool stuff for others in "#share", put experiences in "#experiences", and put lolcats in "#random". Please be respectful of others on Slack.

<b>It is your responsibility to check Slack regularly so that you don't miss important announcements.</b>

##Hours and the MPC Space
The MPC space at UFM is open from 7:00 to 9:00pm, Monday through Friday. 

As a student of the MPC, you have exclusive access to this space. You are always welcome. Please be respectful of others and the resources of the MPC.

<b>MPC Schedule</b>
Bootcamp courses are scheduled for each subject cycle. We don't usually schedule things into the evening because we believe you need time with friends, family, loved ones, and to do other activities. However, we may have fun stuff like movie nights sometimes. These will usually be optional.

Aside from Bootcamp, the MPC does not have an official daily schedule. The schedule emerges from the courses and experiences designed by MPCers. Consult the MPC calendar to find regular seminars, experiences, student-led courses, dialogues with visitors, and other events.

<b>It's important to check Slack, your email, and your calendar regularly.</b>

##Bootcamp
Year one is Learning Bootcamp. The theme of the first year is "Explore Your Calling".

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing

As you master these skills, you'll learn the core ideas of ten subjects.

1. Philosophy
2. Biology and Evolution
3. Psychology
4. Economics, Finance and Money
5. Political Science, Law and Sociology
6. Physics, Statistics and Probability
7. History and Literature
8. Art, Design, and Cultural Evolution
9. Technology
10. Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Why did we choose these subjects? 
Because they're the most important fields for the development of creative individuals. After Bootcamp, you should understand the main ideas of each field. You won't yet be an expert. That's ok! Bootcamp is to help you find direction, not make you into a professor. You'll be ready to decide which areas you want to study more deeply.

What are the "course texts"?
Each subject has texts defined by the subject tutor. Don't worry, the MPC will provide you with digital copies.

Here's important texts for understanding the MPC in general.

2. [You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html)

How will you learn the subjects? 
Dialogues with experts, experiential learning, and independent reading and writing.

Here are the main components of the Bootcamp:
1. Core Dialogues
2. Experiential Learning Days
3. Creative Development Seminars
4. Writer's Studio
5. Bootcamp Learning Contracts
6. MPCafé Performances

The first step to success is showing up. <b>All components are mandatory for Bootcampers</b>

###Core Dialogues
Students have focused dialogues about the main ideas of the subject. <b>You must do your reading before these dialogues begin or you will be lost.</b> Core dialogues meet on Days 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11 of each subject cycle. Occasionally there will be other days devoted to core ideas. These conversations are intense and cover a lot of material, so get a good night's sleep the day before.

####Independent Reading
On Day One of each Bootcamp, you'll choose independent reading in the subject. This reading, selected from a curated list, will inform your talk on MPCafé and your work in the Writer's Studio. Choose something that interests you, because you're going to write and speak about the book. If you really don't like any of the books on the list, you can suggest a book or theme of comparable quality in the subject. But it will have to be approved by the MPC. Talk to the subject tutor if you're confused about your book.

Students can team up on books if they want a dialogue partner as they read. But no freeloading. Students are graded independently for their knowledge of the work, so don't bother trying to hide behind your reading partner.

####Bootcamp Grades
<b>Grading During Bootcamp</b>
Student’s grades are calculated for each subject as follows:

One Third: MPCafé
One Third: Subject Review or Essay
One Third: Attendance in Core Discussions and Experiences

Each of these components is graded three ways.
One Third: Student's Evaluation
One Third: Tutor's Evaluation
One Third: Peer Evaluation

We use participatory grading for each assignment. Students evaluate themselves for one third of their grade in each area. Peers (or the MPCafé crowd) evaluate students for an additional third. An expert mentor from the program evaluates students for the final one third.

<b>Rubrics</b>
<i>MPCafé</i>
How original is the work or argument made in this presentation? (1-10)
How engaging was the speaker’s performance? (1-10)
Is the speaker knowledgeable about his/her topic? (1-10)
Comments:

Student did not arrive to MPCafé. (0/10) 

<i>Essay or Book Review</i>
Use Writer’s Studio Rubrics

Student did not turn in an essay. (0/10)

<i>Participation/Attendance</i>
Tutor takes attendance.

Did the person attend and arrive on time? (10 if yes to both. 5 if late. 0 if did not attend)
Student was absent. (0/10)

<i>Dialogues</i>
Students receive peer-to-peer feedback during dialogues. At the start of each discussion, students are randomly assigned another student’s name. Student’s fill out a feedback sheet for their assigned student and give it to the student at the end of each dialogue. This feedback is in narrative form and does not receive a grade.

Each evaluation operates on a scale of 1-10. Final scores for all three elements are averaged and students receive a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) according to the outcome.

<b>Final Averages</b>
Letter Grade

F: 1 - 1.9
D: 2 - 4.5
C: 4.5 - 6.4
B: 6.5 - 8.4
A: 8.5 - 10

###Writer's Studio
Good writing is clear thinking made visible. Written communication is especially key to the digital age.

Whatever path you take, you need to write well. The MPC Writer's Studio is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. In the first half of Bootcamp, you write book reviews. In the second half, you write essays. Book reviews are less critical and more structured. Essays are freer and include more of your voice. You graduate to the freedom of the essay through rigorous practice of the review.

Students learn writing in a workshop environment throughout the Bootcamp. The first half of the year, students produce book reviews based on their reading. During the second half, students are expected to become more critical and write lengthier, more personal essay on their reading.

#####Book Reviews
Students are responsible for producing a high-quality 1000-2000 word review of their book each subject cycle. 

[Here's the rubric for book reviews and some samples of good work.](https://drive.google.com/a/ufm.edu/file/d/0BwTbZzlJYPL2dG1jUF9PR2xkN3M/view?usp=sharing)

#####Essay
Essays follow a similar format to book reviews. But essays offer greater freedom than the review. There is no page limit to the essay. It is expected to be as concise as possible while still conveying the most important information on their topic. You can include references to other readings and your own opinions. Think of it as an engaging chapter in a book. Make it clear. Make it entertaining. Make it professional.

####Writing Checkpoints
Each week there's an important event in the Writer's Studio.

During week one, students pre-read and write their introduction. The MPC Writer’s Studio meets and we review. 
During week two, students should reach the end of their book. Students produce an outline and write sections to summarize each chapter. 
During week three, students produce a first draft of the entire piece. The Writer’s Studio meets for peer review in groups of 2-3 students. 
During week four, students schedule a one-on-one consultation with a writing tutor. During the final days students prepare to publish their review, share it with their subject mentor, and to participate in MPCafé.

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction
Read preface, introduction, and at least the first chapter of the book. 
Read liner notes and any commentary on the back cover. 
Scan or speed-read the final chapter or conclusion. 

Look for material to include in your intro. Around the middle of the first week, write your introduction—i.e., your first paragraph — focusing on the overarching importance or uniqueness of the book, any controversy it might stir, the author’s reputation, etc.

You need to bring this to the workshop:
1. Your introduction (a strong first paragraph)

Now get reading! You probably should schedule clear reading goals so you finish on-time. Talk to a coach or co-learner if you need help with this.

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters
Finish your book this week. Coordinate your notes and start to synthesize them into paragraph-length summaries of each chapter. Don't just regurgitate. Have some style. Remember that one short, powerful quote is worth more than ten huge block quotes. 

Bring this to the workshop:
1. An outline of your review
2. A first draft of the paragraphs devoted to chapter summaries
3. A first draft of the final paragraph where you offer your own opinion of the book

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review
Time for some serious editing. We'll break up into groups of 2-3 for peer review. Read your work out loud to the reviewers, who take notes and give feedback. Listen to how your writing sounds as you speak it. If it sounds confusing or dumb when it's said – it's bad writing.

Bring this to the peer review workshop:
1. Your complete first draft

[Here's a checklist for peer review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InB9QeJ0qQxazB9ND8TT6mXFqtKxAoMmcnUwBKAMCRo/edit?usp=sharing)

<b>You must schedule a consultation with an MPC writing tutor for the next week</b> You should have revised your draft based on the peer review. Bring a polished second draft to your consultation.

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

Bring this to your consult with a Writing Tutor:
1. Your second draft (which must include feedback from peer review)

[Here's a checklist for final draft review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1do1op-_3iTYL1FXMEXacLEHzs77webrJmNp7RRZn5Tw/edit?usp=sharing)

We'll do this same process for every subject. 
In case you need a reminder, [here's a checklist of all the steps presented here, week-by-week.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-hR9BH3zlUSN8mUYpFovp9n8UW7i5afjCumm3paaYN0/edit?usp=sharing)

###MPCafé
MPCafé is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. Bootcampers give their MPCafé performances about their independent reading. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Essays or book reviews are due on MPCafé. These essays are bound into a Bootcamp Book and given to the students at the end of the first year. Your essay or review becomes a chapter in this student-produced textbook of all ten subjects.

On MPCafé, we open the program to the public. We convert the MPC into a café. Your parents might show up. Students are expected to demonstrate their mastery of their research that month in a creative format. 

MPCafé is mostly for Bootcampers. Students in their second and third years can also show their work on MPCafé. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.

####Public Speaking at MPCafé
Public speaking is a core skill of life, and of the MPC. MPCafé is practice. Writing and public speaking serve different purposes. [Read this essay to understand why](http://paulgraham.com/speak.html). Put simply, writing generates, clarifies, and organizes ideas. Speaking convinces, entertains, and inspires action. A creator needs both.

Your book review or essay should be a clean and accurate exposition of the book. But your MPCafé presentation is your chance to engage more creatively with the ideas. These are not book reports or 'class presentations' like middle school. Get critical with the ideas. Put your own spin on them. Express an argument, point out something insightful or strange.

By default, everyone gives a 5-7 minute TED-talk style lecture on the subject. But MPCafé has an open format. You can suggest something else instead. You have to stand in front of the crowd will all eyes on you. But what you do is up to you.

Example MPCafé presentations might include:
1. A theatrical monologue or dialogue
2. A song about the ideas
3. Sculpture or art on the subject theme
4. A video that you made
5. A timed debate with a classmate
6. A live experiment

The format is up to you. But it needs to include a public-speaking component. Before you perform your song, give some remarks about why you wrote it. Explain your art. Frame the scene.

You can do it alone, or you can work with others. Everyone needs a main role, though. No freeloaders.

<b>Whatever format you choose, your presentation is expected to be strong and professional. Remember, you'll have a real audience.</b>

You'll be graded by the audience and the MPC for your work on MPCafé. Have fun, but work hard.

###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creator is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions specifically about creative development. These discussions have a philosophical and a practical side. Sometimes we'll focus on themes like integrity, authenticity, grit, or creative courage. Other times we'll learn about project management, how to deal with difficult people, or organizational skills.

Starting at Orientation Day, students are asked to examine questions of their own personal philosophy. Students read, participate in discussions, attend workshops, and have experiences meant to encourage them to become more authentic, to give and receive honest feedback, and to become courageous and creative non-conformists.

Students are asked to look deep within themselves to find their a creative calling. As students learn more about the world and understand themselves better, they prepare to enter their second year of apprenticeship and to explore their creative medium in the third year.

> “Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person.” ― Immanuel Kant

###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and writing. In between core dialogues, the subject expert will assign you other activities to learn the ideas. For example, in psychology you may have to go out and sell products using persuasion techniques. Or perhaps we'll visit real biologist's lab during biology. We'll watch films and complete workshops.

Experiential learning will sometimes take you outside the MPC. Come prepared with whatever you need that day (jacket, wallet, phone, etc.)

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
During Bootcamp, we encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. This software is the backbone of the second and third year. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will be held accountable for their learning contracts, but the courses they design will not appear on their transcript.

In later years, you'll design courses that last for a full term. During bootcamp, students design a new mini-course every six weeks. Bootcampers are also encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students and seminars led by coaches. Otherwise, focus on your Bootcamp work.

For Spring 2015 the dates for these mini-contracts are:
January 19 – March 2
March 2 - April 6
April 6 - May 18

<b>The role of Learning Contracts during Bootcamp is to discover what kind of learner you are.</b> Do you work well with online courses? Or should you go find a job or internship to practice your skills? Do you learn best through listening, or perhaps reading? Bootcamp is your chance to discover your learning style at almost no-risk. Work hard on this because, once the second year starts, there's no going back on your contracts.

##The Second and Third Years – Learning Contracts
####Making a Learning Contract
Years two and three are governed entirely by Learning Contract. 

Check out our Learning Contract step-by-step for more details. Watch this intro video for how to use our software.

####Elements of a Good Course
Constant Practice
Do your failing early and often. Practice new ideas and skills as much as you can during the course, so you have something solid by the end.
Clear Outcomes/Metrics. Bad outcome: "I will become a better designer." (This doesn't really tell you if you've achieved the goal!) Good outcome: "I will complete four paid design jobs as a freelancer before the end of the semester." (Success and failure of this outcome is crystal clear.

####Writing a Good Course Description
Course descriptions go into UFM's system of course management. They're tied to the courses you design. If someone wants to know what your class was about, they can access this description. So make it good!

Descriptions should not be fancy or 'clever'. Just be simple and clear. Remember, this is just for a transcript so it doesn't need to be fine art.

Bad description: "The world of cosmology is full of the mystery of the ether. Many great minds have pondered our place in the cosmos for millennia! We will interrogate the deepest cosmic truths to obtain spiritual enlightenment."

Good description: "In this course, we survey the cosmological theories of Bohm, Einstein, and Hawking. Students will read primary texts from each of these thinkers and complete a research project of their own in the theory of cosmology."

####UMAs
UFM organizes courses through credits called "UMAs". An UMA is equivalent to about 15 hours of work. UMAs keep track of your progress toward graduation.

MPC uses a flexible UMA system. Since the MPC does not have traditional classes, the courses you design are assigned UMAs based on their rigorousness. Each term at the MPC is worth 25 UMAs. That's 375 hours of work. Plan accordingly.

That sounds like a lot, but that's about 9 1/2 weeks of work at a full-time job (40 hours a week). You have eighteen weeks to accomplish your goals for the term.

Standard courses worth 4 or 5 UMAs must clearly be rigorous or we won't accept them. Keep this in mind as you plan your contracts.

####Mentors
Mentors are responsible for grading your final evaluation. The MPC can help suggest connections and talk to you about how you can approach a mentor. But you are responsible for finding and confirming your mentor. You may need to be persuasive with some mentors. Your ability to network and secure mentorships is a valuable life skill and part of your education.

Before your Learning Contract is submitted for review, you must confirm the mentors for all of your classes. This means returning (or emailing) a signed and complete mentor agreement form to the MPC for each of your classes.

##Declare your Degree Focus
At the start of your final term, you declare your degree focus. This is like choosingyour 'major' in a traditional program, except you design it.

##Experiences
Experiences bring community in the MPC. Every term, students are required to provide two experiences to the MPC community. You must provide two experiences, even if you're traveling. Get creative.

Draw on your skills or interest. You can organize a dance class or a workshop on debate. You could lead a field trip or other excursion. You can bring in a visiting speaker. If you're traveling, you can Skype in for your experience. You could also produce a video and organize a screening to share it with the MPC instead.

<b>A word of advice: don't put all your experiences at the end of the term. First, you'll be busy with your final evaluations. Second, space and time fill up and you may not have a room available or MPCers will be too busy to attend. </b>

Promote your experience. You're competing against lots of other cool things. But people will show up if you do a good job and tell people about your experience before it begins!

####Milestone Experience
The Milestone is a special type of experience. While MPCers design two experiences for other students, the Milestone is designed for the student herself. Each term MPCers are responsible for one Milestone.

Your Milestone should stretch you beyond your comfort zone. If you're afraid of public speaking, you should give a public lecture. If you've never gone rock climbing, you should go. If you've never been able to continue a habit for more than a week, you could publicly track your habit for three weeks. You could interview someone in a high-pressure situation, or publish something to a wider audience than ever before.

The Milestone is your chance to grow the emotional and psychological skills that you need to be a creator.



##Your First Mentor Meeting
It can be intimidating to ask someone to be your mentor. But you shouldn't be afraid! Most people are flattered and excited when someone is interested in their work. You're so interested, you want to give them the chance to grade your on your work!

However, you should always maintain a professional attitude when you interact with your mentor. Mentors may be busy professionals.

Here's a good way to approach a mentor:
1. Send them an email explaining that you're a student at the MPC, a program that uses paid mentorships to grade students on their work. Thank the mentor for their time.
2. Explain to them that a mentorship is not a significant time commitment. The student is in charge of their learning: mentors aren't expected to hold the student's hand through the course. Mentors are expected to give feedback (either in person or via Skype/email) twice per month and answer the occasional question as the student learns. The mentors will give the student a grade at the end of the term. These are the minimums set by the paid mentorship... a mentor can always agree to chat more or invite the student to events etc!
3. Always be polite with the mentor.
3. Share with them the mentor agreement (link), which discusses payment and responsibilities.
4. Thank the mentor for their time, regardless of what they say!


##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

####Personal Coaches: We keep coaches on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Coaches give regular seminars about areas that they're interested in. Coaches hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

Coaches are also there if you need to talk about something. They'll check in occasionally to see how you're doing toward your goals.

[Here's a link to our Coach's Handbook]()

####Subject Tutors
During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professionals from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 12-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

[Here's a link to our Subject Tutor Handbook]()

We bring in a tutor for each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. These experts take you through the main ideas and are available to answer questions during unstructured time at the MPC. It's your responsibility to talk to them if you're confused.

Tutors also provide a portion of the final grade for each Bootcamp subject.

####Mentors 
The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorships. For example, a student may study programming and have a professional programmer evaluate their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them. Mentors give you grades for your final work.

Remember, mentors are often busy people. You don't want to bother them too often. You should view the mentor as a professional contact, not a 'teacher'. You don't ask your mentor "What is the answer to question 3?" You go and do your best to learn as much as you can on your own. The mentor is there for you bring your work for feedback. "How am I doing?" "I'm really stuck on this part." Mentors also can provide the practical, hands-on experience that books and professors cannot. "How do I make a rigorous practice regimen for the guitar?" "What's the best way to to approach a client?"

You shouldn't just view mentors as people who give feedback and grades. A good mentorship is often the first step to a job or other professional and life opportunities. Treat your mentors well because they can become lifelong friends and contacts.

[Here's a link to our Mentor Handbook]()

####Visiting Professors
We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities. Visitors typically dialogue with students about a topic.

[Here's a link to our resources for Visiting Professors]()

####Writing Tutors
Your writing tutor is there to help you whip your writing into shape. They'll lead the Writer's Workshop and they're available to help you when you need it.

> “Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.” ― Isaac Asimov

##Internships
The MPC requires all students to pursue an internship in their second year. Internships may be taken in either term, or both. Internships can also be pursued in the third year, if necessary. Internships may be paid or unpaid.


An intensive internship could qualify as a 10 UMA course, like a part-time job. A once-a-week or less demanding internship will be listed on your transcript as a 5 UMA course. 

####Why Internships?
Internships are the best way for you to get professional experience in an area that interests you. The modern internship evolved from the apprenticeships of the past. Apprentices were junior members of a craft. They learned by working closely with a master. Their work was often unglamorous, as internships sometimes are today, but the proximity to the master craftsman more than paid for the work.

An internship is a great way to learn whether you actually like a field or industry. You can see how a real professional works. 
Internships also are ways to build your network. Working first as an intern often lead to jobs or other professional opportunities. You should treat your internship as a serious job and part of your education.

####Finding an Internship
As you work with mentors during Bootcamp and in your Learning Contracts, watch for opportunities to intern. Many people want an intern. It's nice to have someone who wants to help you (usually for free), and who is interested in your work. Many people don't know they want an intern until you suggest it... so ask!

The MPC has a rich network of possible internships. Talk to coaches, classmates, mentors, and anyone else around the MPC. Someone will know somebody who can help. On-sight internships are preferred but, if necessary, an internship could even be conducted digitally, with tools like Skype and Googledocs.

If you need help with how to approach an internship opportunity, talk to a coach or peer with more experience. The MPC can help you make a connection, but <b>you are responsible for approaching the mentor and convincing them to employ you as an intern.</b> This is a valuable and important life skill and it's part of your education.

##Graduation and Life Beyond the MPC
We want the MPC to prepare you for life beyond school. As a community for creative development, graduation requirements reflect our commitment to your long term work as a creator.

A few years out of college, when most students are in their mid-20s, people already look more at what you've accomplished than at where you went to school. This doesn't mean that your credential doesn't matter. We want the MPC to provide both: a strong credential and a record of great work.

####Portfolio
In the long run, a portfolio of great creative work is more important than your degree. Your degree and the connections you get from the MPC will open doors and prepare you for graduate school or professional life. But eventually people want to see a strong record of work, not a credential. We want you to graduate with both.

All new students admitted to the MPC are asked to make a portfolio. We base a portion of the admissions decision on it. This portfolio will be the basis of the work you'll build over the program.

Not everything goes in a portfolio. Put stuff that you're proud of and that's relevant to your future customers/bosses/clients. Think of yourself as a brand – how do you want people to perceive you when they browse your portfolio? Portfolios may be on paper or online. Ideally, you should have a version of both.

Portfolios help you get into graduate school and they can land you a good job. If you plan to start your own business or work as a freelancer, your portfolio is like an elaborate business card. Building a portfolio can be fun and it's worth it. Coaches are available if you need help. And don't forget that your peers are there for feedback too.

####Great Work
When you begin your Great Work in the 3rd year, we expect you to take a lighter load of classes. Your Great Work should be clearly incorporated into your contract. Developing your Great Work could be a 10 UMA course, which would leave 10 UMAs left to design additional courses. You're still responsible for your Milestone Challenge and experiences in the MPC.

You might use your Milestone and experiences as a way to further or enhance your great work. Run a focus group for your new business. Do a public reading of your novel in the MPC. Test your app with fellow students. Run a dialogue on the tough creative problem you're facing.

Your Great Work is meant to take you to success beyond the MPC. Students in traditional college programs face a common problem: they graduate with a degree and suddenly find themselves out in the real world with no idea what to do. The Great Work is how the MPC helps students avoid this fate.

Your Great Work should demonstrate your own development as a creator. It's the culmination of your work in the MPC.

Your Great Work should be clearly ambitious and show leadership. Getting a job may be part of your Great Work, but it can't be the whole thing. You need to prove that you are capable of going your own way, even if that means developing something within an existing business or organization. You can do your Great Work with others in the MPC, such as founding a business together – but everyone has to be involved. No freeriders.

#####Great Work Panel
The Great Work panel is how the MPC evaluates your Great Work and the focus you define for your degree. The Great Work Panel is an hour-long discussion with a jury of mentors, peers, or experts in the area of your interest. The Great Work Panel is a more intense version of the interview panel that evaluates students for admission.

The panel evaluates the student's knowledge of their degree focus as well as their progress of their Great Work. Ambitious Great Works are unlikely to be finished by the end of the third year. The panel does not expect the student to have completed everything, but to demonstrate their hard work, their progress, and share the lessons they have learned. Students are also expected to demonstrate significant knowledge in the field of their focus. For example, a student who has studied education and psychology should be able to discuss major ideas in both fields with sophistication and ease.

<b>Panel Makeup</b>
The panel is defined as follows:
1. A panelist chosen by the MPC
2. A panelist chosen by the student (they can not be a family member or close friend)
3. A panelist mutually agreed upon by both student and MPC

<b>Panel Verdict</b>
The verdict of the panel must be <b>unanimous</b> for the student to pass.

<b>Failure of the Great Work Panel</b>
If a student fails the Great Work Panel, the panel will talk with the student about what must be improved. The panel and student will devise a future date to attempt the panel again when the student has made more progress. Students cannot graduate until they pass their Great Work Panel.
