##History of the MPC
Noncoercive education essay. Giancarlo. Late-2012. Brand new model in late 2014.

##The MPCer
As an MPCer, you were chosen as members of a rare breed. MPCers show a rare combination of maturity, focus, and creative talent.

####Creative Professionalism
MPCers train to be pros. 

####Lifelong Learner
Insatiable curiosity



##Bootcamp
Year one is the bootcamp.

The Bootcamp focuses on three main skills: 
1. Reading and Discussing
2. Public Speaking
3. Writing

As you master these skills, you'll learn the core ideas of ten subjects.

Those subjects are:
Philosophy
Biology and Evolution
Psychology
Economics, Finance and Money
Political Science, Law and Sociology
Physics, Statistics and Probability
History and Literature
Art, Design, and Cultural Evolution
Technology
Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Why did we choose these subjects? Because they're the most important fields for the development of creative individuals. After Bootcamp, you should understand the main ideas of each field. You won't yet be an expert. But you'll be ready to decide which areas you want to study more deeply.

How will you learn the subjects? We bring in an expert in each subject to lead discussions on core ideas and to help you with your independent reading. On day one of each Bootcamp, you'll choose independent reading in the subject. This reading, selected from a curated list, will inform your talk on ExpoDay and your work in the Writer's Clinic. If you really don't like any of the books on the list, you can suggest a book of comparable quality in the subject. But it will have to be approved by the mentor.

The main componenets of the Bootcamp are:
Core Dialogues
Experiential Learning Days
Creative Development Seminars
Writer's Clinic
Bootcamp Learning Contracts
ExpoDay

###Core Dialogues
Core dialogues meet on Days 1, 4, 6, 9, and 11. Occasionally there will be other days devoted to core ideas.

###Creative Development Seminars
Growing as a creator is difficult. During the Bootcamp, we also have activities and discussions about creative development. 

###Experiential Learning
The MPC isn't just reading and writing. In between core dialogues, the subject expert will assign you other activities to learn the ideas. For example, in psychology you may have to go out and sell products using persuasion techniques. Or perhaps we'll visit real biologist's lab during biology.

Experiential learning will take you outside the MPC.

###Writer's Clinic
The Writer's Clinic is a regular meeting for Bootcampers to improve their writing. Re

There's an important checkpoint each week.

#####Week 1: Pre-Reading and Introduction

#####Week 2: Outline and Chapters

#####Week 3: Closing, First Draft and Peer Review

#####Week 4: Writing Tutor Consult and Final Draft

###Bootcamp Learning Contracts
We encourage you to test our Learning Contract software. Practice makes perfect! Bootcampers will not be held accountable for their learning contracts. Instead, they are encouraged to drop in on open courses led by other students, seminars led by coaches, and to focus on their Bootcamp work.

###ExpoDay
ExpoDay is a monthly gathering of Bootcampers. It's an important day for students. The MPC opens up to the public. Bootcampers give their ExpoDay talks: 5-7 minute TEDtalk-style presentations about their independent reading. Grades for public speaking are given on this day. Then we have a party and celebrate work well done.

Students in their second and third years can also show their work on ExpoDay. Students may practice public speaking through a talk, or may put their art or other work on display.


##Learning Contracts
Years two and three are governed entirely by Learning Contract. 

Check out our Learning Contract step-by-step for more details.


##Values and Philosophy
At the MPC we value hard work, authenticity, professionalism, and creative individuality.

Hard work means that students are expected to stay in the driver's seat of their education. 

Professionalism means that expect each other to avoid excuses. Any work worth doing is worth doing well. From mentorships to internships to leading an experience in the MPC, we expect everyone to do the best work possible.

Authenticity means that the MPC is a safe place to be yourself. We may disagree, but we don't take it personally. You're free to 
Creative individuality means that everything we do is meant to make you a more confident, skilled, and disciplined creator. Creativity is the ultimate resource. But, sadly, it's rarely cultivated in traditional schools.


##The People You'll Meet
Because of the MPC's unique model, we do not have permanent faculty. Here are the people you'll encounter during your time in the MPC.

Personal Coaches: We keep coaches on hand to help students create courses, and structure their goals and Learning Contracts. Coaches give regular seminars about areas that they're experts in. Coaches hang out in the MPC space. Most are professionals with businesses or other work outside the MPC. We did this deliberately. Keeping active professionals in the space allows students to network for opportunities and to learn from the real experience of others.

Subject Experts: During the first year, we hire experts in individual subjects to lead month-long Bootcamps in 10 different fields. These are professional scholars from UFM and elsewhere. You will work closely with these experts in a group of about 16-18. But there will be plenty of opportunity for one-on-one attention during the courses as well.

Mentors: The Learning Contracts that you design with the help of the MPC uses a system of paid mentorship to create grades and connect you with internships and other experiences. For example, a student this semester is studying programming and we have a professional programmer who is evaluating their final web design project for a grade. The MPC pays these mentors and helps you find them.

Visiting Professors: We bring in speakers and other professors for discussions, debates, and other activities.

##Advice
The MPC is not easy. With freedom comes responsibility. You should take your goal-setting seriously. Set goals that challenge you, but that you can achieve each term. Coaches are here to help. All courses must be rigorous, or we won't approve them.
