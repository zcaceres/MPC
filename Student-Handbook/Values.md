#The MPCer

As an MPCer, you were chosen as members of a rare breed. MPCers show a rare combination of maturity, focus, and creative potential.

Mpc-ers truly care about learning. They aren't afraid to question and they always think for themselves. They are self-standing and logically consistent. They are lifelong learners. Mpcer´s are thinkers and doers, dreamers and creators, artists and entrepreneurs. They are passionate human beings that love what they do. 

Creative Professionalism

MPCers train to be pros. Part of this training teaches them to be not independent but more so interdependent. There is an art when it comes to "dealing with other people". Collaboration is great part of MPC´s creative professionalism.

####Sixteen Habits of Mind
A "Habit of Mind" means having a disposition toward behaving intelligently when confronted with problems, the answers to which are not immediately known.

As additional reference here are also [seven good thinking dispositions](https://learnweb.harvard.edu/alps/thinking/docs/Magnificent7.pdf) that play well along with the 16 habits of mind.


##Values and Philosophy
At the MPC we value hard work, authenticity, professionalism, and creative individuality.

Hard work means that students are expected to stay in the driver's seat of their education. 

Authenticity means that the MPC is a safe place to be yourself. We may disagree, but we don't take it personally. You're free to

Professionalism means that expect each other to avoid excuses. Any work worth doing is worth doing well. From mentorships to internships to leading an experience in the MPC, we expect everyone to do the best work possible.

Creative individuality means that everything we do is meant to make you a more confident, skilled, and disciplined creator. Creativity is the ultimate resource. But, sadly, it's rarely cultivated in traditional schools.


##Advice
The MPC is not easy. With freedom comes responsibility. You should take your goal-setting seriously. Set goals that challenge you, but that you can achieve each term. Coaches are here to help. All courses must be rigorous, or we won't approve them.

Your peers are also a resource. Engage in collaborative work, build working models and rubrics, design courses together, innovate and create. Mpc strives to be an interdependent learning environment, not an independent one.
