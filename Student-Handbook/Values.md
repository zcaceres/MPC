##Values and Philosophy
At the MPC we value hard work, authenticity, professionalism, and creative individuality.

Hard work means that students are expected to stay in the driver's seat of their education. 

Professionalism means that expect each other to avoid excuses. Any work worth doing is worth doing well. From mentorships to internships to leading an experience in the MPC, we expect everyone to do the best work possible.

Authenticity means that the MPC is a safe place to be yourself. We may disagree, but we don't take it personally. You're free to 
Creative individuality means that everything we do is meant to make you a more confident, skilled, and disciplined creator. Creativity is the ultimate resource. But, sadly, it's rarely cultivated in traditional schools.


##Advice
The MPC is not easy. With freedom comes responsibility. You should take your goal-setting seriously. Set goals that challenge you, but that you can achieve each term. Coaches are here to help. All courses must be rigorous, or we won't approve them.
