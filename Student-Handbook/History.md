#A Brief History of the MPC
In 2011, Giancarlo Ibárgüen, former president of UFM, gave a speech called Noncoercive Teaching. In it, he outlined the educational future of UFM. The university should lead not just in Guatemala, but everywhere possible. But for education to change, UFM would need to develop new models from within.

This new model of education would need to embody noncoercion, a founding principle of UFM. The program should give students significant autonomy, use technology well, and rely on dialogue and other forms of learning rather than lectures by progressors.

In late 2012, the MPC sprang to life with 18 enthusiastic students.

Well along the lines of UFM´s origin and vision, the MPC was to bring to education a model that mirrored F.A. Hayek's description of the market as a 'spontaneous order'. Hayek described the competitive forces of the market as “a process of discovery.” The MPC sought to create a continuous "process of discovery" for students.

The original eighteen students, dubbed the 'Pioneers' came from different backgrounds but all wanted a change in their education. Ever since, the MPC strives to improve its model. 

Two years after its founding, the MPC pushed the notion of noncoercive teaching even further and reorganized as a student-led learning community. Twelve of the eighteen "pioneers" remain in the program, plus eight "revolutionaries" that joined in August, 2013.
