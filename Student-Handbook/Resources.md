####Rubrics and Standards 

Rubrics are assesment tools made up of rules or narrative descriptions of ideal conduct or performance. They are used to 
assess and evaluate. The assessment process is essential in any evolutionary process, because it is during assesment that one 
can make choices about what to change or improve. 

There are different kinds of rubrics for different kinds of sessions. Group work, individual work, presentations, writing, all
benefit from a well established rubric.

####Time Management 

- Knowing how much we can accomplish in a given period of time allows us to budget out time more effectively. 
- Divindg our work into a sequence of smaller, manageable tasks makes our goal more attainbale. 
- Assessing our reading speed allows us to plan for the time required to achieve our goal and sets a benchmark for measuring improvement. 

We are often not aware of how long a particular taks is going to take and therefore do a poor job of planning a strategy for 
completing our work. By simply taking note of our own reading speed we can have a tool of measurement that allows us to plan our 
work in "real time" - in units of work accomplished.
