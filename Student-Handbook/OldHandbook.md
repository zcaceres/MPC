Group Work:
Marcela Richardson
 
MPC strives for collaborative learning, rather than focusing on isolated work. By learning collaborative, you are able to express your doubts and concerns with the rest of the group and receive immediate feedback to help progress on your work. Because the group has already become very attached to one another, and they have a very knitted relationship, excellence might be putted aside when feeling in a comfortable attitude within smaller groups. That is why is very important to create certain rubrics to be placed as a standard in order to reach a desired outcome reflected in the quality of the work. 
The students can create their own group rubrics, and present them to one another when about to start working with another person to see if they value the same things. 
Another option is to have a consensus with the entire group, to see which standards they all agree to be the best that reflect a culture of effective collaborative working. 

An example of group rubrics are: 

Address every question one at a time, (do not exclude any)
Discuss only what’s being addressed, when answered, move on.
Active listening
Make your comments as concise and clear as possible
Engage everyone in the conversation
Take notes of what has been agreed 
Document with video, pictures, audio
Make connections that builds on the conversation not the contrary 
Have only one in charge of writing things on the board
Have a process coach to announce when it’s time
