#Tutor Handbook

###Lead by Questioning
The tutor's job is not to force their knowledge on the student. Rather, the tutor should lead students through the subject by questioning. This doesn't mean 'leading' a student to a preconceived answer. It means leading by example. Tutors should demonstrate the openness, humility, but intense curiosity that makes a good student. 

###Expressing Opinions
The MPC does not expect tutors to maintain an artificial environment where they have no opinion or view of the subject. Tutors may express themselves freely and even debate with students in favor of their viewpoint. What's important is not a phony neutrality, but that the dialogue is a safe space for students to disagree.

Tutors who express their opinion on a topic should not speak in a way that suggests their view is final. Be aware of your tone of voice and your body language. These can speak louder than your words.

At all times, tutors should encourage contrarian viewpoints, especially people who disagree with their own view. Model a civil debate where smart people disagree.

###Mentor Responsibilities

####Dialogue Preparation
The tutor should have prepared themselves before the dialogue. Please re-read or at least review the texts or other materials that you will use for the dialogue.

The tutor must also circulate the readings before their time in the MPC begins. Students need sufficient time to prepare for the first dialogue. We share readings digitally, as a PDF. Please talk to the MPC if you need help preparing your course PDF.

####Opening the Dialogue
To open the dialogue, the tutor should clearly indicate the goals of the session. These goals should be based on the core ideas or mental models that students will learn during the dialogue. For example, "Today we'll discuss adaptation, 

####Distribute Dialogue Evaluations
The tutor is responsible for distributing the dialogue evaluations. Every student receives the name of another student to evaluate during the dialogue. The student is expected to note the contributions of their assigned student.
 
####Mentor responsibilities during sessions 

During the session per se, the mentor should listen carefully in anticipation of asking followup questions, monitor the distribution of talk in order to produce a shared dialogue, and map the discussion. His or her goal is that participants experience increased understanding of themselves, the text, and others. 

An effective mentor will: 

- Think about the ideas and values expressed in the dialogue. 
- Question the participants in order to nurture increased understanding.
- Listen actively to each participant and form follow-up questions. 
- Limit teacher talk turns and talk time; distribute participant talk turns and talk time. 

####Thinking about ideas 

A mentor models analytical thinking which for the majority of the seminar displayed by listening to and taking notes on participant comments. Every so often usually in the core section of the session, he or she paraphrases a statement or idea. The mentor mentality is most clearly modeled by posing follow-up questions that push the dialogue to deeper and more sophisticated levels.

####Questioning for increased understanding 

Session mentorship includes both prepared questions as well as genuine, unplanned followup questions. While posing challengiing, open-ended questions, the mentors tone contributes to the thoughtful and collaborative nature of the dialogue. Likewise, mentor questions are posed at a pace that allows think time (silence) for participants and, yet, continuosly moves the dialogue forward. 

Most teachers wait approximately one second after asking a question. However, when teachers wait at least three seconds, student responses increase in levels of thinking.

####Active listening 
The tutor should watch the body language of the participants, gauge the tone of voice used by speakers, and remain aware of the the conversation's flow. Ultimately, the experienced tutor learns to choose the right moment to ask either a planned question or an unplanned follow-up question to nurture a greater depth of understanding. Silence often invites deeper thinking. After stating a question, tutors should be willing to wait until a student responds.

Tutors should not 'answer their own questions.'

####Be careful not to talk too much
The tutor often appears quite passive during a successful dialogue. They may insert a question and then sit silently as students battle over the topic.

####Take Notes
The tutor should take note of especially interesting or significant comments, references to the text, or other issues. Write them down so that you're reminded of key points for later dialogues. 

####Dialogue Debrief 
After the dialogue, ask students to spend a minute or two reflecting on the discussion. Participants then can write notes and feedback to the student they evaluated for the dialogue.

Invite students to continue the conversation on their own, if they wish.


The mentors should always budget some time for participants to reflect on the dialogue process immediately following the session. The first step of post-session process is a brief (1-2 minutes) period of silent assesment. At this point the seminar mentor can faithfully engage in self-assessment as well. Next, time should be spent with the group asessing the collective participation. Then, at least three or four minutes should be allotted for individuals to share aloud their individual self assessment. Finally, the mentor may ask the group to identify what might be the process goals in the next session. 

####Hang out for Office Hours After the Discussion


The last step in facilitation is the post-session content stage. As in the pre-session content, the main job of the mentor is to give clear directions and explicitely state the purpose - why we are doing the session and perhaps where this session is leading; this would be the time when the teacher makes connections and points to the bigger picture od the curricular unit or project (ultimately their Great Work). 

"To be in truth, we must know how to observe and reflect and speak and listen, with passion and with discipline, in the circle gathered around a given subject."

- Parker, J. Palmer, The Courage to Teach
