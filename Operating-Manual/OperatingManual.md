##How to evaluate a Learning Contract
Here's what to look for:
Rigor
1. Is it rigorous? Students should pursue a significant piece of work
2. Look at the UMAs budgeted for the course load. Make sure that the courses justify a 20 UMA load.
3. 

Mentor
Is the mentor confirmed?
3. Does the mentor have relevant expertise for this contract?
4. Is the mentor related to the student or otherwise presents a conflict of interest?
5.

Great Work
1. Courses that incorproate a great work can have a value of between 6 to 8 UMAs.


####The Great Work in the Learning Contract

####Orientation Day
Have students sit in a U shape with their laptops ready. Skype in any students who can't be present in person. Have the administrator explain the admission process to students. Have students schedule a PAA, make MiU account, and other admin processes.

Here's a list of all the Admin processes:

####Furniture and Physical Space Design


####Give Students real Responsibilities for MPC Services
For example, a student that wants to develop a café should be in charge of MPCafé. An event planner can be the lead coordinator for MPCafé.


Duties of the Curator
Maintain a high standard in learning contracts, in admissions, and with visitors and tutors. Maintain brand value.

Be a good steward of the physical space.
How to pick good stuff for the physical space:

####Special Offerings
Occasionally the MPC will offer special open courses. Some will be opportunities at UFM or with friends of the MPC. These are published on the platform and have a clear UMA value. The MPC must make these courses and they will be available to the students on the platform to enroll. Some special offerings may be competitive or require an application process before a student is accepted. Make sure you advertise these courses. Post the descriptions on Slack and elsewhere in the space.

###Quality Control
Administrators should check in at least once a day with students. Ask at least three students a simple question like, "How is it going?" "Is everything going ok?" Read between the lines. If a student seems hesitant to speak, don't force the issue. Instead, remind them with something like the following: "Well, please let me know if you can see areas to improve. That's my job."

###Monitoring the Mentor Relationship
The MPC should not be directly involved in the students' mentor-mentee relationships. However, administration should check in with students. "How's everything with your mentors?" works just fine. If there is a problem, students are usually quick to bring it up when asked.

Administration should be vigilant to sudden changes in students mood or behavior after they begin mentor/mentee relationships. While there have not been any problems in the MPC so far, it's important to be aware of unhealthy relationships. If a student expresses that their mentor makes them uncomfortable or crossed personal lines, the MPC must offer the student the option to change mentors. If a mentor has made students uncomfortable, they should be removed from any databases of the MPC so that no further students interact with them.
