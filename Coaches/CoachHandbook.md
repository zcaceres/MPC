#Coach's Handbook
This handbook is designed to assist coaches in their duties at the MPC.

##Contract and Portfolio Weeks
Coaches are most active during the weeks where students design their learning contracts and review their portfolios. Typically, these are the first and last weeks of the semester.

During contract week, students will need lots of one-on-one attention to set their goals and design their courses. Plan to extend your hours.

During portfolio week, students meet with coaches and peers to share and evaluate their portfolios and progress toward their Great Work.

##Role
The role of coaches is to help students develop as creative individuals. Coaches are there to coach, not to command, nor to mold students in a predefined image. Coaches encourage students. This encouragement is focused on helping students reach their goals and develop the good habits of a growth mindset.

##Attitudes
Coaches are at the MPC to help students develop a growth mindset and to raise their self-esteem and motivation.

Coaches should never praise students for being "smart" or "talented". These traits suggest to the student (and any nearby students) that their abilities are fixed by genetics or luck. Coaches should praise the students "hard-work", "discpline" or "focus" instead. These traits are choices and habits that students can develop.

Coaches look for signs of aptitude and interest in students. These aptitudes are often highly specific. For example, a student with a flair for writing may shine most of all through sonnets. Another students with talent for music may come alive most during jazz improvisations.

Coaches should keep notes of the aptitudes and interests that they spot in students. Coaches then encourage the student. They should not force the student, because the coach may perceive the situation incorrectly. Instead, the coach should make themselves available to talk further about the aptitude or interest and suggest ways that the student can creatively pursue them. This fine-grain attention is what separates the MPC from other programs.

##Software
Coaches will be trained in the use of MPC software when they are hired.



##Techniques
<b>The 'Grandmother Method'</b>
During their available hours, coaches should use the grandmother method. Coaches circulate throughout the space, find students and ask them: "What are you working on?"

Coaches should listen attentively as the student explains. Then they should ask questions to ask the student to elborate on their work.

Coaches should not judge the student's work. They should encourage the student with positive remarks like, "That's really interesting!" and "Wow! What will you do next?" It's called the Grandma method because you grandmother never judges you. She just looks over your shoulder, sounds impressed, and encourages.

It's best not to interrupt students who are reading, look deep in thought (for example, with headphones on), or have gone off to a quiet space by themselves. Look for students in the shared spaces.

Coaches and students will eventually have a more neatly established schedule 

##Check-in Log
After each day, coaches should take 5-10 minutes to record their interactions with students. Did the student seem troubled? Happy? Enthusiastic about a particular subject? Write it down. Please also share lessons you learned or techniques that you found that worked well.
