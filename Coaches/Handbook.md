#Coach's Handbook
This handbook is designed to assist coaches in their duties at the MPC.

##Contract and Portfolio Weeks
Coaches are most active during the weeks where students design their learning contracts and review their portfolios. Typically, these are the first and last weeks of the semester.

During contract week, students will need lots of one-on-one attention to set their goals and design their courses. Plan to extend your hours.

During portfolio week, students meet with coaches and peers to share and evaluate their portfolios and progress toward their Great Work.

<b>The 'Grandmother Method'</b>
During their available hours, coaches should use the grandmother method. Coaches circulate throughout the space, find students and ask them: "What are you working on?"

Coaches should listen attentively as the student explains. Then they should ask questions to ask the student to elborate on their work.

Coaches should not judge the student's work. They should encourage the student with positive remarks like, "That's really interesting!" and "Wow! What will you do next?" It's called the Grandma method because you grandmother never judges you. She just looks over your shoulder, sounds impressed, and encourages.

It's best not to interrupt students who are reading, look deep in thought (for example, with headphones on), or have gone off to a quiet space by themselves. Look for students in the shared spaces.
